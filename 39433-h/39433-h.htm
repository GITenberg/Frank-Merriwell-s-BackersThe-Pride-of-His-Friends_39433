<h3>EXCELLENT BOOKS OF GENEROUS LENGTH</h3>

<h2>THE NEW MEDAL LIBRARY</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Issued Every Week</i>.     ::     <i>Price, 15 Cents</i>
</p>


<p>This is a line of books for boys that is of peculiar excellence.
There is not a title in it that would not readily sell big if published
in cloth-bound edition at $1.00. One of the best features about
these books is that they are all of the highest moral tone, containing
nothing that could be objectionable to the most particular
parents. Next in importance, comes interest, with which every
one of these books fairly teems. No more vigorous or better
literature for boys has ever been published. New titles by high-priced
authors are constantly being added, making it more and
more impossible for any publisher to imitate this line.</p>


<p class="center">ALL TITLES ALWAYS IN PRINT</p>

<blockquote><p>TO THE PUBLIC:&mdash;These books are sold by news dealers everywhere.
If your dealer does not keep them, and will not get them for
you, send direct to the publishers, in which case four cents must be
added to the price per copy to cover postage.</p></blockquote>

<h3>IN THE TRAP.</h3>


<p>Millions of bright stars shone serenely through the
clear Arizona night, shedding their soft white light
on the great arid plains and the mysterious mesas and
mighty mountains.</p>

<p>Throughout the night Frank Merriwell lay ensconced
behind some sheltering rocks in a deep ravine,
where he had been trapped by the ruffians in the employ
of the mining trust, who were determined to
wrest from him the precious papers they believed to
be in his possession.</p>

<p>Old Joe Crowfoot, the aged Indian friend of Merriwell,
who had been snared with him, had, shortly
after nightfall, taken the precious oilskin package, containing
the papers, and crept forth on his stomach,
like a snake, from amid the rocks.</p>

<p>Joe had promised to take the papers to the nearest
registry post-office, in case he escaped, and send them,
according to directions, to Richard Merriwell, Frank's
brother, at Fardale.</p>

<p>Frank had written a letter to Dick, and had securely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
tied up and directed the package. He trusted
the aged redskin, who declared that he might find a
method of escaping from the trap, yet could not take
the white youth with him. He had made certain that
Joe understood the matter of registering the package,
in case he should reach the post-office with it in his
possession.</p>

<p>Merriwell had become satisfied that this was the
best course to pursue. It was plain that he was in a
very bad trap, and he knew those ruffians could soon
starve him out. There was no water or food for himself
or his horse. A day of thirst behind those rocks
must surely do for him.</p>

<p>If Joe carried out the plan successfully, the papers
would be placed beyond the reach of the ruffians, even
though Frank fell into their hands. And it was the
papers they had been engaged to secure. Were they
to kill him, Dick would have the precious papers and
be able to continue the battle for his rights.</p>

<p>Merry watched old Joe wiggle silently away, wondering
that the Indian could slip along in that manner
with so very little effort. The old redskin lay flat
on the ground and took advantage of every little cover
he could find, and soon he vanished amid the rocks
and passed into the shadows, after which Merry saw
him no more.</p>

<p>Down the ravine a great mass of rocks and earth
had been blown down by a mighty blast and blocked
the passage.</p>

<p>Up the ravine armed and murderous men were waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and watching, ready to shoot down the youth they
had trapped.</p>

<p>There were also armed ruffians on the barrier to
the southeast. They had trailed Merry with the persistence
of bloodhounds.</p>

<p>A full hour passed. The men above were making
merry in a boisterous way. One of them began to
sing. He had a musical voice, which rang out clearly
on the soft night air. Strangely enough he sang
"Nearer My God to Thee."</p>

<p>Could they be watching closely? It did not seem
so.</p>

<p>Frank rigged his coat on the barrel of his rifle.
On the muzzle of the weapon he placed his hat. Then,
he lifted coat and hat above the rocks.</p>

<p>Crack!  Ping!</p>

<p>The ringing report of a rifle and the singing of a
bullet. The hat and coat dropped. In the coat Merriwell
found a bullet-hole. That settled it. There was
no longer a doubt but that the desperadoes were watching
like wolves.</p>

<p>Yet old Joe had been able to slip forth from the
protection of those rocks and creep away.</p>

<p>More than ever Merriwell admired the skill of the
Indian. Thinking that the old fellow had instructed
Dick in the craft which he knew so well, Frank believed
such knowledge had not been acquired in vain.
Some time Dick might find it very valuable to him.</p>

<p>There was a hoarse burst of laughter from the
watching ruffians.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Merriwell!" called a voice.</p>

<p>"Well," sang back Frank, "what do you want?"</p>

<p>"Stick that thing up again. We'd like a leetle target
practise."</p>

<p>"You'll have to provide your own target," Merry
retorted.</p>

<p>"Oh, we reckons not! We'll stand you up fer one
sooner or later," was the assurance.</p>

<p>Still they had not discovered old Joe. It seemed
marvelous.</p>

<p>The night passed on. Another hour was gone when
there came a sudden commotion far up the ravine, as
if on the further outskirts of the ruffians. There were
hoarse shouts, angry oaths, the rattle of shots, and
then the clatter of iron-shod hoofs.</p>

<p>The ring and echo of those clattering hoofs receded
into the night, coming back clear and distinct
at first, but growing fainter and fainter.</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell laughed and lay still until the
sound of the galloping horse had died out in the distance.</p>

<p>"Old Joe is on his way to the post-office," muttered
Merry. "He took a fancy to acquire one of their
horses in order to make better time."</p>

<p>The ruffians were filled with more or less consternation.
They continued to wrangle angrily. At last,
one cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, Merriwell!"</p>

<p>Frank lay perfectly still and made no answer.</p>

<p>"Oh, Merriwell!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Peering forth from amid his rocky barrier, yet
crouching where the shadows hid him, Frank cocked
his rifle and pushed it forward for use.</p>

<p>There was a time of silence, during which he fancied
the men were consulting in whispers. Finally his keen
eyes saw something move into the dim white light
above some boulders. He laughed a little in a suppressed
way and sent a bullet through the moving
object.</p>

<p>"Put it up again!" he called cheerfully. "I don't
mind a little target practise myself."</p>

<p>He knew the thing had been thrust up there to
draw his fire and settle the question if he still remained
in the trap. But he had shown those ruffians
that he could shoot as accurately as the best of them.</p>

<p>After this he heard the men talking. He knew
they were bewildered by what had happened. They
could not believe it possible that a human being had
crept forth from the snare. It seemed to them that the
person who had seized their horse and ridden away
had come upon them from the rear and was in no way
connected with Merriwell.</p>

<p>After a time they were silent.</p>

<p>They were satisfied that the trap held fast.</p>

<p>Then Frank found a comfortable place where he
was perfectly hidden and coolly went to sleep, with
his hand on his cocked rifle.</p>

<p>Merriwell needed sleep, and he did not hesitate to
take it. It spoke well for his nerves that he could
sleep under such circumstances. It may seem that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
did not speak so well for his judgment. Still he knew
that he would awaken at any sound of an alarming
nature, and he believed those men would rest content,
satisfied that they had him caged where there
was no possibility that he could give them the slip.</p>

<p>After an hour or more, he awoke and demonstrated
the fact that he was still behind the rocks by exchanging
a challenge with the watching ruffians.</p>

<p>Then he slept again.</p>

<p>And so the night passed on.</p>

<p>Frank was wide-awake with the coming of dawn.
He saw the stars pale and die in the sky. He saw
the gentle gray of morning and the flush of sunrise.
Far up the ravine rose the smoke of a camp-fire, telling
where the ruffians were preparing breakfast.</p>

<p>"Oh, Merriwell!"</p>

<p>"Hello, yourself!"</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. I have plenty to eat."</p>

<p>"Are you thirsty?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. I have my canteen."</p>

<p>"That'll be empty right soon. How would you like
some steamin' hot coffee?"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't go bad. Send some in."</p>

<p>"We'll exchange a pot of coffee for sartin papers
you has with yer."</p>

<p>"You're very kind!" laughed Merry derisively.</p>

<p>"It's a right good offer. We're goin' to have them
papers anyhow, an' you may not even git coffee fer
them."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're due for the greatest disappointment of your
lives, gentlemen," declared Frank. "If you're looking
this way for papers, you're barking up the wrong
tree."</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't fool us!" was the answer. "We
know you've got 'em, and we'll have 'em."</p>

<p>"Ever gamble?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"Oh, we sometimes take a chance."</p>

<p>"I'll go you my horse and outfit against that of
any one in your party that you don't get the papers."</p>

<p>"Done! It's a sure thing as far as we're consarned.
We has yer foul, an' we'll stay right yere till
we starves ye out."</p>

<p>"Too bad to waste your valuable time so foolishly.
But, say!"</p>

<p>"Say it."</p>

<p>"I see no particular reason why my horse here
should go hungry and thirsty."</p>

<p>"Not the least. Bring the pore critter right out."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon if I seem a trifle lazy, but it's too
much bother. However, I'll send him out, and I'll
look to you to see that he's properly cared for."</p>

<p>Without exposing himself, Frank managed to get
the horse out from the niche in the wall where he had
been placed, headed the animal through a break in
the rocky barrier and sent him off, with a sharp crack
of the hand.</p>

<p>The horse galloped up the ravine, finally saw human
beings, stopped, snorted, seemed about to turn back,
but finally kept on and disappeared.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Frank settled down to wait, being resolved
to give old Joe plenty of time.</p>

<p>The day grew hot in the ravine, where there was
little air. The sun beat down with great fierceness
from the unclouded sky. Those mountains seemed
bare and baked. Little wonder that their repelling
fastnesses had presented little attraction for the prospector.
Little wonder it had often been reported that
they contained no gold.</p>

<p>But Frank Merriwell's "Queen Mystery" Mine lay
in that range, and it had developed so richly that the
great Consolidated Mining Association of America
was straining every nerve to get possession of it&mdash;to
wrest it from its rightful owner.</p>

<p>So Frank baked in the sun, taking care to keep
well hidden, for he knew those men would gladly end
the affair by filling him full of lead, if they were given
the opportunity.</p>

<p>Once or twice he caught glimpses of them. Several
times they challenged him. He was prompt to answer
every challenge, and he did not wish to shoot
any of them.</p>

<p>He had fully decided on the course he would pursue;
but he was determined to give Joe Crowfoot
plenty of time to perform his part of the program.</p>

<p>Frank smiled in grim irony over his position. He
took it philosophically, satisfied that that was the best
he could do. He did not worry, for worry would do
him no good.</p>

<p>He was given plenty of time to reflect on the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
pursued by the syndicate, and it made him wonder that
such high-handed things could take place in the United
States.</p>

<p>It seemed rather remarkable that the head of the
mighty syndicate, D. Roscoe Arlington, was the father
of Chester Arlington, Dick Merriwell's bitterest enemy
at Fardale.</p>

<p>Frank had encountered Mr. Arlington. He had
found him blunt, grim, obstinate, somewhat coarse, yet
apparently not brutal. Being a clever reader of human
nature, which many are not who pride themselves that
they are, Frank had become satisfied that there were
many men in the world who were far worse than D.
Roscoe Arlington, yet were considered models of virtue
and justice. Arlington was not a hypocrite. He
was bluntly and openly himself. He had set out as
a poor boy to make a fortune, and now it seemed possible
that he might become the richest man in America.
Comfortable riches had first been the object for which
he strived; but when his scheming poured wealth upon
him, he set the mark higher. He determined to be
one of the very rich men of the United States. That
goal he had now arrived at; but the mark had been
lifted again, and now he was determined to become the
richest.</p>

<p>Arlington had not ordered those ruffians to take the
papers from Frank. Still he was back of it all. He
had turned the matter over into the hands of unscrupulous
lieutenants, instructing them to employ any
means within their power to obtain possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Queen Mystery and San Pablo Mines. Those lieutenants
were directing the operations of the ruffians.</p>

<p>It is quite probable that Arlington did not wish to
know the method employed by his lieutenants. All he
desired was the result.</p>

<p>Frank had also met Mrs. Arlington, and he had seen
in her a haughty, domineering, icy woman, ready to do
anything to gain her ends. She was proud and high-headed,
although she had once been a poor girl. She
looked down in scorn and contempt on all poor people.</p>

<p>But Merry had not forgotten June Arlington, who
had a truly high-bred face of great attractiveness, and
who was vivacious yet reserved, proud yet considerate,
high-spirited yet kind. He had not forgotten the girl,
and ever he thought of her with feelings of kindness,
for with her own hands she had restored to him the
precious papers when they had been stolen from him,
by agents of the trust, assisted by her mother.</p>

<p>He knew Dick admired June, and he did not wonder
at it, for about June Arlington there was such
fascination as few girls possess.</p>

<p>Still Merry could not help wondering if June would
one day develop into a woman like her mother. Such
a result did not seem possible.</p>

<p>Midday passed, and the afternoon waned, yet without
any diminishing of the scorching heat in the ravine.</p>

<p>Frank's water was gone, and he began to feel the
torments of thirst.</p>

<p>He had counted the time as it passed. Finally he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
was satisfied that Crowfoot had accomplished the task
he had set out to perform. The papers were mailed.
Probably they were already on their way to Dick Merriwell
at Fardale.</p>

<p>"Well," muttered Frank, "I think I'll go out and
look these ruffians over now."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<h3>IN THE HANDS OF CIMARRON BILL.</h3>


<p>A shout quickly brought an answer.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Frank, "I'm for a parley. What
say you?"</p>

<p>"We're willing. Parley away."</p>

<p>"If you were to get those papers I suppose you
would feel yourselves perfectly well satisfied?"</p>

<p>"I reckon you've hit it good an' fair."</p>

<p>"Such being the case, if I come forth with hands
up and empty, I take it you won't take the trouble
to shoot me up any?"</p>

<p>"None at all," was the assurance promptly given.
"If you comes out like that, you has our promise not
to do any shooting whatever."</p>

<p>"And how about the gentlemen below?"</p>

<p>"They'll do no shootin' unless you goes that way."</p>

<p>"Is this all on the square?"</p>

<p>"You bet! Bring out that old redskin with ye, an'
let him keep his hands up, too."</p>

<p>"I think you've made a mistake, gentlemen; there
is no redskin with me. I am quite alone."</p>

<p>"We knows better! Ye can't play any tricks on
us!"</p>

<p>"I am willing to convince you. Just keep your fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
off your triggers. Watch me as close as you
like. I'm coming!"</p>

<p>Having said this, he left his rifle lying on the
ground and rose to his feet with his hands held open
above his head.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that he did not do this without
some doubt concerning the result, for he knew those
ruffians were very treacherous; but somehow he was
satisfied that they had been instructed to obtain the
papers, if possible, without killing him, and that belief
led him to run the risk that he now faced.</p>

<p>He was ready to drop instantly if they fired as he
arose into view. A moment he stood quite still, and
then, as no shot rang out, he stepped through amid
the boulders and walked boldly up the ravine.</p>

<p>In this manner, Frank walked straight into the
midst of a party of nine thoroughbred frontier desperadoes,
who were waiting for him, with their weapons
in their hands.</p>

<p>The leader was a thin, dark-faced, fierce-looking
man, who covered Merry with a revolver.</p>

<p>"I rather 'lowed you'd come to it," he said, in satisfaction.
"But I told ye to bring that old Injun along."</p>

<p>"And I told you there was no Indian with me. I
spoke the truth."</p>

<p>"Say, youngster, did you ever hear of Cimarron
Bill?"</p>

<p>Frank looked the fellow over with his calm eyes.
He saw a cruel, straight slit of a mouth, a thin black
mustache, with traces of gray, and sharp, cruel eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
set altogether too near together. He had heard of
Cimarron Bill as the most dangerous "man-killer" in
all the Southwest.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said quietly, "I have heard of him."</p>

<p>"Well, you're lookin' at him. I'm Cimarron Bill.
The butts of my guns have seventeen notches in 'em.
You may make the eighteenth."</p>

<p>Merriwell knew what the ruffian meant, yet he
showed no signs of fear.</p>

<p>"I have heard," he said, "that Cimarron Bill has
never yet shot a man in cold blood or one who was
unarmed."</p>

<p>"I opine that's right, young man; but this case is a
leetle different. It's not healthy to irk me up under
any conditions, and so I advise you to go slow."</p>

<p>Frank smiled.</p>

<p>"I have no desire or intention of irking you up, sir,"
he said. "I am giving you straight goods. There is
no Indian with me."</p>

<p>"There was last night."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't opine he's melted into the air or
sunk into the ground, an' tharfore he has to be
yander behind them rocks."</p>

<p>"I give you my word, sir, that he is not there, and
has not been there since last night."</p>

<p>The ruffians had gathered about and were listening
to this talk. Picturesque scoundrels they were, armed
to the teeth and looking fit for any job of bloodshed or
murder. They glared at the cool youth standing so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
quietly in their midst; but he seemed perfectly at his
ease.</p>

<p>"Sam," said the leader, turning to one of them, "go
out yander to them thar rocks an' look round for
that redskin."</p>

<p>Sam, a squat, red-headed desperado, seemed to hesitate.</p>

<p>"What ef the Injun is waitin' thar to shoot me up
some as I comes amblin' along?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Go!" said Cimarron Bill, in a tone cold as ice. "If
the Injun shoots you, we'll riddle this here young gent
with bullets."</p>

<p>"Which won't do me good none whatever," muttered
Sam; but he knew better than to disobey or
hesitate longer, and so, dropping his rifle into the
hollow of his left arm, he stepped out and advanced
toward the spot where Merriwell had been ensconced
behind the boulders.</p>

<p>The brutal band watched and waited. Cimarron
Bill surveyed the face of Frank Merriwell, more than
half-expecting the youth would call for Sam to come
back, knowing the fate that would befall him in case
the Indian began to shoot.</p>

<p>But Sam walked straight up to the boulders, clambered
onto them, and looked over into the hiding-place
that had served Frank so well.</p>

<p>"Derned ef thar's ary livin' critter hyer!" he shouted
back.</p>

<p>"Make sure," called the leader, in that metallic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
voice of his, which was so hard on the nerves. "Don't
make no mistake."</p>

<p>Sam sprang down behind the boulders. They saw
his head moving about, but, very soon, he clambered
back over them and came walking rapidly away.</p>

<p>"The varmint is sartin gone," he averred.</p>

<p>Immediately Cimarron Bill thrust his cocked revolver
against Frank Merriwell's temple.</p>

<p>"Tell us where the Injun is!" he commanded.
"Speak quick and straight, or I'll blow the top of
your head off!"</p>

<p>"I am unable to tell you just where he is at present,"
said Frank, with that perfect coolness that so astonished
the desperadoes. "He left me last night."</p>

<p>"Left you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How? We had this side guarded, an' ther boys
below kept close watch."</p>

<p>"All the same, I think Joe Crowfoot passed you.
How he did it I do not know. He told me he could."</p>

<p>The leader of the ruffians looked as if he was not
yet willing to believe such a thing had happened; but
there no longer seemed much chance for doubt.</p>

<p>"Then it must have been that red whelp who stole
one of our hosses!" he said.</p>

<p>"I think it was," nodded Merry. "Something like
two hours after he left me I heard a commotion this
way, followed by some shooting and the sound of a
galloping horse, which died out in the distance."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the men began to swear, but Bill silenced
them with one swift look from his evil eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, that sure is the limit!" he observed, trying
to hide some of his disgust. "We didn't opine a kitten
could sneak past us without being seen an' shot up."</p>

<p>"A kitten might not," said Frank. "But old Joe
Crowfoot should be compared with a serpent. He has
all the wisdom and craft of one. I depended on him,
and he did not fail me."</p>

<p>"Where has he gone? State it&mdash;state it almighty
sudden!"</p>

<p>"If he followed instructions, he has gone to Holbrook."</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"To send a message for me to my brother."</p>

<p>"A message? What sort of a message?"</p>

<p>"A letter and some papers."</p>

<p>"Papers?" said Cimarron Bill, in a low, threatening
tone. "What papers?"</p>

<p>"Certain papers referring to the Queen Mystery and
San Pablo Mines, which I own."</p>

<p>A look of disappointed rage contorted the cruel
face of the murderous ruffian. The lips were pressed
together until they appeared to make one straight line
no wider than the thin blade of a knife. The eyelids
closed to narrow slits, while that dark face turned to
a bluish tinge.</p>

<p>Many times had Frank Merriwell stood in deadly
peril of his life; but, looking at that man then, he well
knew that never had his danger been greater. Still, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
he regretted his act in walking forth and surrendering
himself into the hands of such a creature he effectually
concealed it. He betrayed not a whit of trepidation or
alarm, which was a masterly display of nerve.</p>

<p>The ruffians began to murmur fiercely, like the
growling of so many wolves. Perhaps it was to this
outbreak that Merry owed his life, for the leader suddenly
bade them be silent, and the sounds ceased.</p>

<p>"So you sent those papers off by that old redskin,
did you?" asked Bill.</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"And you have the nerve to come out here and tell
me that! If you had known me better, you would
have stayed, and choked and starved, or even shot
yourself behind those rocks, before doing such a
thing!"</p>

<p>Merriwell made no retort, for he felt that too many
words would be indiscreet. This man was capable of
any atrocity, and another straw might break the
camel's back.</p>

<p>"Mr. Merriwell," said the ruffian, "I came here for
them papers, and I'm goin' to have them!"</p>

<p>"You may take my life," said Merry; "but that will
not give you the papers. In fact, it will utterly defeat
the object of those men who have employed you to
obtain them."</p>

<p>"How do you figger that out? With you out of
the way, they'll have less trouble in takin' your mines."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, if I am murdered, the fact will
react against them. I have written a full account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the facts concerning my position and fight with the
syndicate to my brother, to be used in case anything
serious happens to me. With that, and with the papers
I have sent him, I fancy he can so arouse public indignation
against the syndicate that the men who are
pushing this thing will be glad enough to pull in their
horns and quit the battle. So you can see that by
killing me you will defeat the object of the syndicate
and disgust it with your method of procedure."</p>

<p>Frank spoke those words convincingly, and certain
it is that he made an impression on Cimarron Bill.
The other ruffians, however, who failed to reason
clearly, were fierce enough to shoot the captive where
he stood.</p>

<p>Bill stood still and looked the young man over, beginning
to realize that he was dealing with a youth
of more than ordinary courage, resource and sagacity.
His respect for Merriwell was beginning to develop
amazingly.</p>

<p>Frank could read the man well enough to feel that
the danger-point had been successfully passed, and he
breathed more freely, although there was no outward
change in his manner.</p>

<p>"I'm not yet satisfied that you're not lying to me,"
said the chief of the ruffians; whereupon he ordered
his satellites to search the captive.</p>

<p>The closest search, which was supervised by Bill,
failed to bring to light the package of coveted papers.</p>

<p>Bill seemed to pass a few moments in thought.
Then he said:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll all go over yander and have a look round
among the boulders."</p>

<p>With Frank in their midst, they proceeded to the
spot where he had successfully held them off. As they
went forward, they called to the men down the ravine,
and soon those ruffians came hastening to join them.</p>

<p>"Have ye got the papers?" demanded one called
Big Monte, a strapping ruffian, who was the leader
of the party.</p>

<p>When he learned what had happened the giant swore
in angry disappointment.</p>

<p>"However did you all happen to let the Injun slip
ye that way?" he demanded scornfully.</p>

<p>Bill looked him over.</p>

<p>"I opines you're not castin' reflections any whatever?"
he said, in a deadly manner.</p>

<p>Big Monte looked large enough to eat the thin,
dark-faced chap, but he hastened to disclaim any intention
of "casting reflections," whereupon Bill gave
him no further heed.</p>

<p>The chief set them to searching amid the boulders,
overseeing it all and taking care that no possible place
of concealment was neglected. But all this search came
to nothing, and the baffled wretches were finally forced
to confess that they were outwitted.</p>

<p>But Merriwell was a captive in their hands, and in
their disappointment they might be led to revenging
themselves upon him.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<h3>INTO THE NIGHT.</h3>


<p>Cimarron Bill was a man who disliked being outwitted
and outdone, especially by a youth of Frank
Merriwell's years, and he was one who was not at all
likely to let such a thing pass without seeking to recover
and accomplish his object by some method, failing
in which, he was almost certain to take summary
and tragic vengeance on the one who had baffled him.</p>

<p>Merriwell knew well enough in what peril he stood,
and yet he maintained his manner of composure.</p>

<p>Bill spoke to two of the ruffians, of whom Big
Monte was one, and Sam, the red-headed rascal, the
other.</p>

<p>"You two take charge of this here altogether too
smarty young gent," said the leader of the desperadoes,
"and look out for him a heap close. Don't let him
come none of his slick tricks on you, for you will be
held responsible for him, and I opines you know what
that means."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll take care of him!" said Sam significantly,
as he fingered the butt of a pistol. "All I wants is a
right good chance to do that!"</p>

<p>Bill fixed the red-head with a look of his narrow
black eyes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"At the same time," said he, "permit me to suggest
that you lets no special harm come to him, as I reckons
him valuable property just about now, and I may need
him a whole lot later. If anything unnecessary happens
to the young gent, you'll deal with me for it!"</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Merry felt somewhat safer
in the hands of those ruffians after that, for he began
to perceive that, for some reason, Bill wished to preserve
him for the time being without harm.</p>

<p>Apparently the captive gave little heed to these
words, but in truth he missed nothing.</p>

<p>As the others drew aside with Bill, Big Monte took
a picket rope, observing:</p>

<p>"I allows, Sam, that we'd better be keerful, jest as
the boss suggests, fer it ain't a whole lot healthy to
have anything happen contrarywise to his wishes.
Such bein' the case, I propose we tie up this here
young gent some, so he'll not bring trouble on hisself
an' us by tryin' to lope out."</p>

<p>Sam looked disappointed.</p>

<p>"I was a-thinkin'," he said, "that I'd like to see him
try to lope; but sense the boss has put it so plain, I
kind of changes my mind, an' I thinks your propersition
is kirect. Go ahead, Monte, while I keeps him
kivered with my shootin'-iron."</p>

<p>Frank made no objection as Big Monte tied his
hands behind him. He knew it was quite useless, and
so he submitted with a meekness that was rather deceptive,
for it seemed to indicate that he was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
awed by his situation and the men who had taken
him captive.</p>

<p>"I judges that will do," said the big man, having
bound the rope about Merry's wrists until it was uncomfortable
in its tightness. "He's good an' fast
now."</p>

<p>Merriwell sat down on a rock, while the two ruffians
flung themselves on the ground in the shadow of the
wall and waited the end of the consultation between
the chief and the remainder of the band.</p>

<p>Bill was talking to his ruffians in his low, quiet way,
and they were listening. Frank wondered what was
passing, but they were too far away for him to hear.</p>

<p>At last, one of the men, who had but one arm,
started off from the others, hurrying toward the
horses. Bill had thrust something into this man's
hand, seeming to give him a final admonition. Five
minutes later the one-armed man, mounted on the very
best horse he could find, rode away at good speed.</p>

<p>Even then Merry did not conceive that it was the
desperate purpose of One-hand Hank to follow those
papers all the way to Fardale, if necessary, in the attempt
to gain possession of them. He fancied that
Hank meant to try to find the Indian, with the hope
that the papers still remained in old Joe's possession.</p>

<p>Bill came back and stood looking Merriwell over.
Several of the men had departed toward the spot
where the horses were kept.</p>

<p>"I reckons you thinks yerself some slick, kid!" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
said, with cold contempt. "You'll git all over that
before you're through dealin' with Cimarron Bill. I'm
sartin to take the conceit out of ye a whole lot."</p>

<p>To which Merry vouchsafed no retort.</p>

<p>"Bring him along," said the chief, to Sam and
Monte. "We're goin' to pull up stakes and hike."</p>

<p>So Frank was marched up to the horses, among
which was his own animal, which had been captured
by the ruffians.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, gentlemen," said Merry, "it
would give me considerable satisfaction to imbibe a
little water."</p>

<p>"You'll choke plumb to death afore ye ever gits a
drap from me," averred Sam.</p>

<p>Whereupon Bill looked at the red-head sharply, saying:</p>

<p>"Sam, give him a drink from your canteen."</p>

<p>And Sam did so.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Merry easily. "It was the desire
for water that led me to saunter out from my place
among the rocks earlier than I intended. I feel much
better now."</p>

<p>His saddle had been brought along, and, when it
was strapped upon his horse, he was tossed into it by
Big Monte and another. The rest of the band had
prepared to move, with the exception of those who
had come from down the ravine and one fellow who
seemed to have taken the place of the departed fellow
with one arm. These men had horses beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
rocky barrier that had been blown down to prevent
Merriwell from escaping in that direction, and it was
necessary for them to return and pursue another
course, as the horses could not be brought over that
barrier.</p>

<p>There was little delay when everything was ready.
Bill took the lead, and those who were to follow did
so, the captive in their midst; his horse led by one
of them.</p>

<p>The others had turned back.</p>

<p>The sun was descending peacefully behind the barren
mountains, and night was spreading her sable
pinions over the land. There was gold in the western
sky. The heat yet seemed unabated, save in the valleys
and gorges; but later it would become unpleasantly
cool.</p>

<p>In silence those men rode onward, with their dark,
cruel-faced leader at their head. The hoofs of the
horses clinked and rang, bestirring the echoes; and,
when the gloom of night had stolen upward from the
gulches, there came an occasional spark like a firefly
when the iron of a hoof struck a flinty rock.</p>

<p>So night came on, and still they went forward.
Frank wondered what their destination could be;
but he saw they were taking a course that must bring
them nearer the Queen Mystery Mine.</p>

<p>He wasted no words in seeking to engage any of
them in conversation. All the while, however, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
thoughts were busy. He wondered much if he could
come safely through this perilous mischance and how
it was to be accomplished. For Frank had not given
up, and he had confidence that somehow he would find
a way, or one would be opened to him.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<h3>IN THE OLD HUT.</h3>


<p>In a valley amid the hills that lay at the base of
the barren mountains stood an old hut. Who had
built it there? It seemed that it had, beyond doubt,
been erected by some prospector. What fate had befallen
the builder no man knew. The hut remained,
weather-worn and falling to pieces.</p>

<p>The coming of another day found Frank Merriwell
a captive in that hut, closely guarded. The ruffians
had stopped there, for in the vicinity could be found
wood and water, and feed for the horses.</p>

<p>Some time during the night they had been joined
by Big Monte and the others who had turned back to
secure the horses beyond the barrier in the ravine.</p>

<p>In the morning the men lay about in the vicinity of
the hut. Two fires had been built, and breakfast was
preparing.</p>

<p>Inside the hut an armed man kept guard over the
captive. At intervals the guard was changed, but
always a man was near with a pistol ready to shoot
Merry down if he offered to make a break for freedom.</p>

<p>But Frank seemed strangely contented. After the
ride through the night, he asked for a blanket to make
himself comfortable, suggested in a pleasant way that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
it would be agreeable to have the cords about his wrists
loosened a little, as they were chafing him and his
wrists were swollen, and, when the ropes were entirely
removed, then lay down on the blanket and went
calmly to sleep.</p>

<p>Merry slept until one of the men brought him some
breakfast. This fellow kicked him to awaken him,
whereupon Frank looked up and observed:</p>

<p>"Gently, partner&mdash;gently! You don't have to kick
in a rib in order to get my eyes open."</p>

<p>"Ef it wasn't fer ther boss," said the fellow, "I'd
take a heap o' satisfaction in kickin' ev'ry dern rib
outer ye!"</p>

<p>"Then I am thankful for the boss."</p>

<p>"Hush! Mebbe ye thinks so now; but wait till he
gits round ter deal with ye. I opines he'll disterb ye
some."</p>

<p>"Well, don't lead me into worriment before it is
necessary," entreated Frank, with a smile. "As long
as I'm comfortable, I see no reason to disturb myself
over what may happen&mdash;for there is always a chance
that it may not happen."</p>

<p>"Waal, not in this case. Ye've robbed us outer a
clean two hundred dollars apiece by sendin' off them
papers."</p>

<p>"Only that? Why, you seem to be cheap men! I
should fancy it would take at least five hundred each
to hire men to go out to commit robbery and murder."</p>

<p>"Thar ain't no robbery about it."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, you don't tell me? Perhaps you are right,
but the object was robbery, all right enough."</p>

<p>"Nary robbery! Ther papers belongs to ther gents
what wants to git 'em an' what engaged Bill to do the
job."</p>

<p>"Possibly I might convince you to the contrary if I
had time; but just now I will admit that I'm remarkably
hungry. Put down the feed right here on the
floor, and I'll turn to directly."</p>

<p>As the man stooped to put down the stuff, as directed,
he brought his head quite close to Frank's lips.
In the fellow's ear Merry whispered:</p>

<p>"I'll make it one thousand dollars in your fist if you
find a way to help me out of this scrape."</p>

<p>The man started a little, gave Frank a look, then
glanced toward the armed guard, who had heard nothing.</p>

<p>Merry touched a finger to his lips, thus enjoining
silence.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he exclaimed. "Thank Bill for me! This
coffee smells most satisfactory. It will serve finely to
wash down the hard bread and beef. To a healthy appetite,
like mine, this will be a feast fit for an epicurean."</p>

<p>The ruffian looked at him in apparent wonderment.</p>

<p>"Fer a cool galoot, you sure are the limit!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Then he went out.</p>

<p>Frank wondered if his proposal to the fellow would
bear fruit. He knew well enough that these men stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
in great awe of Cimarron Bill; but would the greed
of this one overcome his fears of the chief and lead
him to attempt to set Frank at liberty?</p>

<p>That was a serious question.</p>

<p>Having eaten heartily, Merry once more made himself
comfortable and slept.</p>

<p>When next he was awakened, Cimarron Bill himself
was sitting near, smoking a Spanish cigarette.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Frank.</p>

<p>"It's a long distance past morning," said the leader
of the ruffians. "You've slept away the whole morning.
You seem to be takin' it a heap easy and comfortable
like."</p>

<p>"Just bottling up a little sleep in case of need," said
Merry, sitting up and placing his back against the
wall. "There's no telling when I may have to keep
awake a whole lot, you know."</p>

<p>"Instead of keeping awake," said Bill, in a sinister
manner, "you're a heap more likely to fall asleep some
of these yere times an' never wake up."</p>

<p>"In that case, it will be of no consequence, so I am
not losing anything by sleeping while I may."</p>

<p>The man surveyed Merry long and intently, as if
trying to probe the nature of this cool youth. At last,
he turned to the sentinel and dismissed him.</p>

<p>The sentinel went out, closing the door.</p>

<p>Bill lighted a fresh cigarette.</p>

<p>"Young man," he said, "I want to inform you right
yere and now that it will do you no good whatever to
try to bribe any of my men."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Possibly not," said Frank noncommittally.</p>

<p>"You bet your life it won't!" said Bill emphatically.
"Thar ain't one of them but what knows me, an',
knowin' me, thar ain't one what would dare play me
crooked. Savvy?"</p>

<p>"It's quite plain."</p>

<p>"It's straight goods, Merriwell. A while ago you
offered one of 'em a thousan' dollars if he would find
a way to get you out of this."</p>

<p>"Correct," admitted Merry immediately. "And
had he accepted the offer and accomplished the job, I
should have congratulated myself on getting off very
cheap."</p>

<p>He had seen at once that it was useless to try deception
or denial with Bill, and so he spoke frankly.</p>

<p>"That's right," nodded Bill. "A thousan' would
be small money fer such a job; but it ain't no use, for
none of them will take the job at that or five times
as much. 'Cause why? 'Cause they knows me,
Cimarron Bill, right well. They know I'd sure settle
up with 'em if they done any crooked work. They
have seen the notches in my guns. Some of 'em has
seen me shoot."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear sir," smiled Merry, "I don't presume
you fancied I would remain here like a man in a
trance without trying to get away in some fashion?"</p>

<p>"I hardly opined that would be your style. But I
has to warn ye that you has about one chance in fourteen
million of gettin' off with a hull hide. I keep a
guard inside and outside, besides another over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
hosses. I don't want to shoot ye&mdash;now&mdash;but it sure
will be done if you breaks an' runs fer it."</p>

<p>"Of course I'd have to take chances on that."</p>

<p>"Don't! But your offer to Jake has set me thinkin'.
Somehow I kinder take to your style."</p>

<p>"Thanks!" laughed Merriwell.</p>

<p>"You has a heap of nerve for a youngster."</p>

<p>"Thanks again!"</p>

<p>"And I opine we'd make a pretty strong team together.
Such bein' the case, I has a propersition to
make to ye, whereby, in case you accepts, you gits outer
this scrape in a hurry an' none the worse for wear."</p>

<p>"Let it drive," said Frank. "I'm listening."</p>

<p>"Like 'most ev'rybody," said Bill, "I'm out fer the
dust. That's what brought me up against you. I
opined you'd be easy meat. I've sorter changed my
mind. You look an' talk like a tenderfoot, but I take
it that you has your eye-teeth cut, an' this yere ain't the
first time you've seen Arizona."</p>

<p>"I have been in Arizona before. I have likewise
been in various parts of the West."</p>

<p>"I knowed it," nodded Bill. "I likewise opine you
has a whole lot of fight in ye."</p>

<p>"Well, I rather enjoy the strenuous life."</p>

<p>"But you're certain up against a right powerful combination
in this yere gang what means to have your
mines."</p>

<p>"Without doubt."</p>

<p>"You needs assistance to hold them there mines.
Such bein' the case, suppose we strikes a partnership,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
you an' I, an' stan's by each other. You'll find me a
right handy partner when it comes to fightin', an' I
kin back ye up with a gang what will wade through
gore fer me. Under them circumstances, I reckons we
kin give this yere minin' trust a run fer its money."</p>

<p>"Your offer is very interesting, not to say fascinating,"
confessed Frank. "But there is something behind
it. Come out with the whole matter."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to come out with, save that I'm to
be taken in a half-partner in your mines."</p>

<p>"Only that?" smiled Merry scornfully.</p>

<p>Bill did not like the manner in which the youth spoke
those two words.</p>

<p>"I 'lows," he said, "that you'll be gettin' off a heap
cheap at that. If you fails to accept, it's almost certain
your friends never hears of you no more. You'll be
planted somewhere yereabouts. Arter that, the minin'
trust will have easy goin'."</p>

<p>"Well," said Merry, "I presume you will give me
time to think this matter over?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I gives ye till to-morrer mornin'."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>Again Bill lighted a fresh cigarette.</p>

<p>"But, without 'pearin' to press ye too hard, which
might cause ye onpleasant rememberances in the futer,
I hints that I'll be a heap riled up if you fails to accept
my offer."</p>

<p>Then Bill called the guard and sauntered out.</p>

<p>Frank had no thought of permitting the desperado
to force him into such a partnership, but he believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
that it would be well to appear to take time to consider
it.</p>

<p>That afternoon, toward nightfall, he was permitted
to go outside in the open air, with two armed guards
watching over him.</p>

<p>Frank inhaled the open air with a sense of gratitude,
for the hut had become stuffy and oppressive.
He looked around, noting the surroundings, without
betraying any great interest in the location. He saw
that all about the hills rose to enclose the valley, but
conjectured that the party had entered from the south
or southeast.</p>

<p>By this time the men were interested in him, and
they looked him over curiously. Four of them were
playing cards, and Merry sat down on the ground
where he could watch the game.</p>

<p>"You don't want to be makin' no remarks about
what keerds ye sees in anybody's hand, young man,"
growled one of them, whose cards Merry could see.</p>

<p>Frank smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm not quite that fresh," he said. "I have played
the game occasionally myself. If I had a chance to
sit in, I might give you some points."</p>

<p>They laughed derisively at that, for the idea that
this smooth-faced youth could give them points at
poker seemed preposterous.</p>

<p>"Why, ef you got inter this game we'd skin the eye-teeth
outer ye!" declared one.</p>

<p>"You'd be easy pluckin'," said another.</p>

<p>"It would be a shame to rob ye," sneered a third.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
"But seein's you ain't got no dust we won't have that
pleasure."</p>

<p>"If it's dust that bars me," said Merry, "I might
have enough to last a hand or two. I see you're playing
five dollars limit, with a two bits edge."</p>

<p>"Why, you're plumb skinned dry!" said Big Monte.
"You ain't got no stuff."</p>

<p>Whereupon Frank displayed a little thin wad of
bank-bills, amounting to about twenty-five dollars in
all.</p>

<p>They were astounded, for no money had been found
on him when he was searched for the papers.</p>

<p>"How is this?" growled Monte. "Whar did ye keep
it hid?"</p>

<p>"That's my business," said Merry. "If you're anxious
to teach me this game let me in."</p>

<p>They made a place for him, assuring him that he
would "last quick."</p>

<p>Now Merry was a most adept poker-player, although
he let the game entirely alone, not believing in gambling.
He was also a clever magician, and he could do
tricks with cards to astonish far more astute men than
these ruffians.</p>

<p>It was Pinto Pede's deal, and the Mexican handled
the cards in a slick manner. Without pretending to
watch him, Merry really kept a close eye on the fellow's
movements.</p>

<p>Pede looked his cards over carelessly. Big Monte
chipped a dollar, the next man raised him a dollar, and
it was up to Frank, who immediately raised five.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Monte laughed hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Throwin' yer money away right off, eh?" he said.</p>

<p>The man after Frank dropped out.</p>

<p>Pinto Pede raised five dollars.</p>

<p>The fellow whose edge it was dropped his cards, but
Monte came in, as did the next man and Frank.</p>

<p>"How men' card?" asked the Mexican.</p>

<p>"I'll take two," said Monte.</p>

<p>"Better draw to the strength o' yer hand," advised
the next man. "Gimme three."</p>

<p>Pede looked inquiringly at Merry.</p>

<p>"One card," said Frank.</p>

<p>Pede frowned and looked annoyed. He had stacked
the cards, and everything had worked perfectly up to
Merriwell, who had been given three jacks on the
deal, and whom the Mexican had expected would draw
two.</p>

<p>"You take da two card!" exclaimed Pede. "Yo' no
fool anybod' with da side card."</p>

<p>"I'll take one!" said Frank grimly. "If I choose
to hold a side card to threes that is my business. Perhaps
I have two pairs."</p>

<p>The Mexican had betrayed his trick by his anger at
Merry's style of drawing. Writhing with anger, he
tossed Frank one card.</p>

<p>"I tak' two," he said.</p>

<p>Merry leaned forward and watched the Mexican's
fingers so closely that Pede was given no chance to
perform any crooked work, if he had contemplated it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now we're off," said Frank. "Go ahead and do
your betting."</p>

<p>Then he glanced at his cards. He had held up a
five spot with his three jacks. To his satisfaction, he
found Pede had given him another five spot.</p>

<p>Merry had conceived that it was the Mexican's plan
to give him threes and then to fill his hand with a small
pair, but to take a pair himself, having on the deal
secured threes of a higher denomination than those in
Merry's hand. For that very reason, Frank had decided
to draw one card, instead of two, thinking to
defeat Pede's object in securing a full.</p>

<p>By a strange chance, Frank had held up a five spot,
while all the time Pede had been intending to give him
a pair of fives. This being the case, the youth secured
his full hand just the same, but without the knowledge
of the dealer. At the same time, he spoiled Pede's
draw, for the pair the Mexican had counted on getting
had been divided, he getting instead one of the fives
intended for Merriwell. This left Pede with three
queens, a five, and a nine.</p>

<p>But the Mexican believed that Merriwell had secured
only threes, as he did not dream for an instant that
the side card held up with the three jacks could be a
five spot.</p>

<p>In case Frank had three jacks only, Pede's three
queens were "good."</p>

<p>The betting began.</p>

<p>Monte started it with a dollar.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>The next man had failed to improve his hand, and
he fell out.</p>

<p>Frank raised five.</p>

<p>Pede shoved in six dollars, and added another five.</p>

<p>"I tak' dis pot," he said.</p>

<p>Monte looked his cards over. Then he looked at
Pede. He knew the Mexican.</p>

<p>"You oughter be shot!" he said. And he threw his
cards down, turning to Frank.</p>

<p>"You ain't got a ghost of a show agin' that greaser,
youngster," he averred.</p>

<p>"Well, as long as my money lasts I'll stay with
him," smiled Merry.</p>

<p>He did. Having thrust the last of his money into
the pot, he finally called.</p>

<p>Pede spread out his three queens, smiling with crafty
triumph.</p>

<p>"You no fool me," he said. "My t'ree bigger dan
your t'ree. I tak' da mon'."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Merry. "I happen to have
more than threes here."</p>

<p>And he displayed his full hand, coolly raking the
money over to his side of the blanket.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<h3>PINTO PEDE RECEIVES HIS LESSON.</h3>


<p>Pinto Pede was the most disgusted Mexican in all
Arizona. At the same time he was thoroughly thunderstruck.
That Merriwell had secured the pair of
fives with his three jacks for all of his style of drawing
seemed like legerdemain.</p>

<p>Big Monte gave a shout of surprise, that was not
entirely unmingled with delight.</p>

<p>"Waal, say!" he roared; "that's the furst time I
ever seen Pede done up on his own deal by a tenderfoot!
Haw! haw! haw!"</p>

<p>As the game continued Frank soon demonstrated
that he was quite capable of holding his own with
those men. On his deal he simply played "hob" with
them. In less than thirty minutes he had won over
a hundred and fifty dollars.</p>

<p>Cimarron Bill had sauntered up and was standing
near, his arms folded, silently watching the progress
of the game.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Frank finally, "you're too easy
for me. Just to show you how easy you are, I'll deal
a hand around and then tell you what you have."</p>

<p>"Not if you lets me cut," declared Monte.</p>

<p>Merry had gathered the cards and was shuffling
them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may cut," he said.</p>

<p>He put the cards down on the blanket, and Monte
divided them into two parts, after which he watched
Frank to see that he picked them up right.</p>

<p>Merry picked them up with one hand, doing so
swiftly. He picked them up all right, but he cleverly
made the pass, which restored the cards to their original
positions, as they were before Monte had cut.</p>

<p>Then he dealt.</p>

<p>When they picked up their cards, he began at the
left and called off the cards each man held, going
around the entire circle.</p>

<p>Monte threw his down, with a cry of amazement.</p>

<p>"An' this yere is what we takes for an easy mark!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"He cheat!" grated Pinto Pede. "Dat how he win
all da mon'."</p>

<p>"I don't want your money," said Merry. "I find it
too easy to make money off such chaps as you. You
talk about tenderfeet, but the East is full of tenderfeet
who could skin you fellows to death. If you ran
into a New York bunco man he'd have your boots off
your feet in less than thirty minutes. In fact, gentlemen,
you need to get your eye-teeth filed."</p>

<p>He was laughing at them, as they plainly saw. This
made Pinto Pede furious, and, with a cry of rage, the
Mexican snatched out a knife, flung himself forward
on his knees, clutched the captive's throat and seemed
about to finish him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Quick as a flash, Merriwell had seized Pede's wrist,
which he gave a twist that made the bones crack and
brought a yell from the yellow-faced fellow's lips.
The knife dropped. Merry tossed it over his shoulder,
and then flung Pede backward, groaning over his
wrenched arm.</p>

<p>"The only safe way to play such tricks on me," said
the undisturbed captive, "is to catch me when I'm
asleep."</p>

<p>Then Cimarron Bill spoke, and they saw he had a
pistol in his hand.</p>

<p>"It sure is a good thing for Pede that the gent
stopped his play just as he did, for if Pede had done
any cuttin' I'd sartin shot him up a whole lot. I has
told you boys that Mr. Merriwell is to be kept safe
an' unharmed until I gits ready to finish with him,
an' when I says a thing like that, I generally has a way
o' meanin' it. If Pede had used his knife, I'd a-let
daylight through him instanter."</p>

<p>Now they all knew Bill spoke the truth, and so
Pede was doubly humiliated.</p>

<p>"He was a trifle hasty," said Merriwell coolly. "I
was about to explain that I never keep money won at
cards, as I do not believe in gambling. I sat in this
game to illustrate to you fellows that it doesn't always
pay to get puffed up and look contemptuously on
a tenderfoot. Having made the lesson plain, I will
withdraw my own money, which will leave the amount
I have won. You may divide it equally among you
and go on with your game."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>This Frank did exactly as he said, taking himself
out of the game.</p>

<p>There would have been a quarrel over the division
of the money had not Bill interfered.</p>

<p>Possibly Frank was counting on that quarrel, for a
fight among the men might have given him an opportunity to
escape. However, if such was his plan, it
miscarried, for Bill acted as judge and saw that the
matter was settled without further dispute or bloodshed.</p>

<p>Merry turned away, his hands in his pockets, seeming
to take no further interest in the gambling ruffians.
They looked after his fine, supple, manly figure,
and Big Monte said:</p>

<p>"Gents, he shore is a hummer! I admits it now.
He's put up a heap different from any tenderfoot I
ever struck afore. We knows he kin shoot, fer didn't
he perforate Sam's coat back yander in the raveen
when Sam h'isted it on his rifle. We know he kin
play keerds, fer didn't he jest demonstrate it to our
complete satisfaction. We know he has a heap of
nerve, fer he sure has showed it all the way through.
An' I'm bettin' he's goin' ter make it a right hot
fight afore the galoots what are arter his mines gits
what they wants."</p>

<p>"You forgits he's dealin' with Bill," said one of the
others; "an' Bill shore has the keerds stacked on
him."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Monte; "but you got ter
do somethin' more than stack the keerds on that young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
chap. Didn't Pede do that, an' didn't he beat Pede a-plenty
at his own game? That showed me that you
never kin tell when you has Frank Merriwell beat fer
fair."</p>

<p>Frank had known all the time that Bill was watching.
He had played the game more for the benefit
of the chief of the rascals than any one else. At the
same time, it had served to pass away a little time
and had been a diversion for the moment.</p>

<p>The guards also were near, watching every move
closely.</p>

<p>Frank had satisfied himself that there was no chance
of making a break to escape without throwing his life
away, and so he seemed to return to the hut with
perfect content. Indeed, his nonchalance and apparent
lack of fretfulness and dissatisfaction over his misfortune
was most amazing to the rough men.</p>

<p>Merry ate supper heartily.</p>

<p>There was a clay fireplace in the hut, and, the night
coming on cool, a fire was built there. Merry lolled
before the fire on the hard-packed earth, which served
as a floor to the hut. Bill came in, sat down on the
ground, and rolled a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Well," he finally said, "how do you find yourself
to-night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, comfortable," carelessly answered Frank.</p>

<p>"Smoke?"</p>

<p>"Never do."</p>

<p>"Drink?"</p>

<p>"Out of my line."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Still you can shoot and play poker! I certain admits
you're a queer one!"</p>

<p>After a little silence, Bill again dismissed the guard.
Then he said:</p>

<p>"I'm in a leetle hurry to know what your answer
is to that there propersition I made ye. I sw'ar, partner,
I sure reckons we'd make a hot pair. I takes to
you!"</p>

<p>"You're very complimentary!"</p>

<p>"I'm givin' it to ye straight. You're my style.
Now, I wants ye ter know that I kin be of great service
to ye, so I reckons it was well enough to tell ye
what has been done. You sent them papers to your
brother in the East. Well, I has sent one of my best
men a-chasin' the papers, an' he'll be sure to get 'em
if it kin be did. If he succeeds, you'll be plumb out in
the cold. Howsomever, in case we rigs up a partnership,
it won't be nohow so bad, fer my man he
brings me the papers, an' that fixes it all right.
Savvy?"</p>

<p>"That is the way you look at it."</p>

<p>"Sure. You may have thought you was a-givin' me
too much to let me have a half-share in your mines;
but when you reckons that you gits your liberty, my
friendship, and you has your papers saved, which same
otherwise would go to the minin' trust, I opine you'll
come to see that you're not makin' such a powerful
bad trade after all."</p>

<p>"But it is not at all certain that you'll get possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of those papers. In fact, everything is against such a
thing happening."</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"How do ye make it out?"</p>

<p>"My brother knows his business, and he will take
care of the papers."</p>

<p>"How did you send them?"</p>

<p>"Registered mail."</p>

<p>"So I opined. Now you knows it takes things registered
a heap sight longer to travel than it takes other
mail."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Such bein' the case, One-hand Hank is powerful
sartin to git thar ahead o' the letter."</p>

<p>"He may."</p>

<p>"In which case he watches the post-office close.
When he sees your kid brother take out the package,
he follers the boy, taps him on the kebeza, knocks him
stiff, takes the papers and ambles. See how easy it
is to be did?"</p>

<p>"It is easy enough to talk about it; but my brother
is pretty shrewd, and One-hand Hank will have the
time of his life getting those papers."</p>

<p>"You don't know  Hank. He's perfectly familiar
with the East, an' that was why he was sent. One
time he escaped from Sing Sing. That was when he
had two good arms.   He's a mighty bad man, an' he'll
eat up that brother of yours but he'll have the papers."</p>

<p>"I give you my assurance that Dick will sit hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
on Hank's stomach. I am not greatly worried, for
all of what you have told me."</p>

<p>Bill frowned.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "I did have some intentions
of usin' persuasive measures on ye, such as puttin' your
feet to the fire, or things like that; but I holds them
things off to the last finish, as I opine a partnership
brought about that there way would be onpleasant to
us both."</p>

<p>"Rather," laughed Frank.</p>

<p>"Still," said Bill; "I may have to be rather harsh,
which certain would grieve me up a lot with such a
fine young fellow as you are. I hopes you don't
bring me none to that. Thar's no chance fer you to
give me the slip. I've taken mighty good keer of that
p'int. It will save ye a great amount of trouble if
you decides to-night that we becomes pards. I'll jest
walk out with ye an' interduce ye to ther boys as
equal with me, an' ev'rything will be lovely. I don't
reckon you'd be fool enough to go back on any sech
arrangement you made, fer Cimarron Bill ain't the
man to be throwed down in such a way."</p>

<p>"There is no need of even suggesting a threat," said
Merry. "If I enter into such a partnership with you,
you can be sure I'll stand by it."</p>

<p>Bill urged him to make the agreement at once, but
still Merry declined.</p>

<p>"Time is right precious," said the leader of the
ruffians.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'll give you an answer to-morrow."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>And that was all Bill could get out of him then. So
the chief fell to talking of other things, and they
chatted agreeably for some time.</p>

<p>When the ruffian was ready to retire, he called the
guard. Then he bade Frank good night and went out.</p>

<p>Merry slept with the same amazing peacefulness.
But some time in the night he started wide-awake,
seeming to feel near him the presence of some one.</p>

<p>The fire had died out, save for a few glowing coals
on the hearth. The sentinel sat rigid in his corner.
Merry could not tell if he slept or not.</p>

<p>Outside the cabin something seemed to brush lightly
against the wall.</p>

<p>This gentle sound was not repeated. After listening
a long time, Frank fell asleep once more.</p>

<p>In the morning he found a black feather where it
had fallen to the ground after being thrust through
a crack in the wall.</p>

<p>At sight of the feather he started. Then he hastened
to pick it up and conceal it.</p>

<p>For that feather told him that old Joe Crowfoot
was near. It promised escape from the hands of the
ruffians, and caused Merry to suddenly cease planning
himself and trust things wholly to Crowfoot. He
knew old Joe would find an opportunity to try to aid
him to escape.</p>

<p>That morning Frank was asked by Bill to come out
and take breakfast with the rest of the men, an invitation
which he willingly accepted, as he was beginning
to thirst for the open air.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a glorious morning, just as all mornings in
that land of eternal sunshine seem to be glorious.
The elevation was sufficient to give the air a pleasant
coolness. The sun shone down brightly. The horses
fed in the valley. The men were lazing about, as usual.
Never had Merry seemed so perfectly at his ease as he
was on this morning. He was in a jovial mood. Some
of the men attempted to chaff him.</p>

<p>"You're right peert fer a tenderfoot," said Red
Sam. "But the effeet East is ruther slow as compared
with the West, you knows."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," smiled Frank, sipping his
coffee. "In what way is the East behind the West?"</p>

<p>"Waal, when it comes to fast trains, we lays away
over the East out yere."</p>

<p>"I have my doubts."</p>

<p>"Waal, you see it's this a-way," said Sam, winking
at some of his companions, "the trains out yere don't
hev to stop ev'ry few miles, an' so, havin' once got
started, they kin keep increasin' an' a-pilin' on speed
till they literally tears along. Now, thar's the Overland
Express. Why, I was a-ridin' on that train oncet
when she was jest running at comfortable speed, and
the telygraft-poles beside the track seemed as nigh
together as teeth in a fine-tooth comb."</p>

<p>"That's speedy," confessed Frank.</p>

<p>"You bate. But it warn't northin' to what she did
later. A hot box, or somethin', kind o' delayed us, an'
we hed to make up lost time. Sir, it's a fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
arter she got on full head the telygraft-poles looked
presactly like a solid fence along beside the track!"</p>

<p>"But you see," said Frank, "you confess that your
trains out here have to take time to get up such high
speed. That is where they are behind the trains in
the East."</p>

<p>"How?" demanded Sam contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Why, having to stop often, the Eastern trains make
it a practise to start quick and at high speed. They
don't have to pump away for fifteen or twenty miles in
order to get to going at a comfortable rate of speed.
Instead of that they start right off at full speed. Now
there is a train runs between New York and Washington.
I got aboard at the station in Jersey City.
My girl had come along to see me off. I opened the
car window and leaned out to kiss her good-by, and,
so help me, I kissed a colored woman in Philadelphia!"</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, and then Big Monte
gave a roar of delighted laughter. This was the kind
of humor he could appreciate, and the fact that Red
Sam had been doubly outdone by the tenderfoot gave
him great joy.</p>

<p>The others laughed, also, and their respect for their
captive rose several notches.</p>

<p>Cimarron Bill thoroughly appreciated Merry's cleverness
in getting ahead of Red Sam.</p>

<p>"That youngster'd make the greatest pard a man
could tie to!" thought Bill.</p>

<p>After breakfast Merry coolly sauntered about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
hut. He was followed everywhere by the two guards,
but he gave them no heed whatever. He looked for
some further sign of old Joe, but saw nothing.</p>

<p>Merry wondered how the redskin would go to work
to accomplish what he meant to attempt.</p>

<p>Bill let Frank alone until after dinner. Then he
sat down with Merry, they being by themselves, and
again broached the subject that seemed uppermost in
his mind.</p>

<p>"See here," said Frank, "I offered one of your men
a thousand dollars to get me out of this. The same
offer stands good with you."</p>

<p>The dark face of Cimarron Bill flushed and he
looked deadly.</p>

<p>"Mebbe you don't know you're insultin' me a heap!"
he said. "Such bein' the probable case, I resents it
none. The minin' trust has promised me five thousan'
when I turns them papers over."</p>

<p>"Which you will never do."</p>

<p>"Which I'll sure do if you gits foolish an' refuses
to tie up with me."</p>

<p>"Well," said Frank, "I'm not bidding against the
mining trust. I have refused to recognize that organization."</p>

<p>"Then you refuses my proposal?" said Bill, in that
cold, dangerous voice of his.</p>

<p>"Not that. I want until to-morrow morning to
think it over. Just till to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You'll give me my answer to-morrer mornin'?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then it's settled that you has that much more time.
I won't ask ye no more about it until to-morrer morning;
an' then you must sure give an answer. I knows
what that answer will certain be if you has the level
head I thinks."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<h3>INJUN JOE TO THE RESCUE.</h3>


<p>Along in the middle of the night Frank awoke.
Again he was overcome by that strange feeling that
some person was near him. Then he felt a touch, light
as a feather, and saw at his side a dark figure.</p>

<p>The starlight came in at the small, square window.</p>

<p>A hand grasped Frank's wrist and gave it a gentle
pull. There was not even a whisper. Merry knew
what was wanted.</p>

<p>Without making a sound, he crept across the ground
to the wall, where a timber had been removed from
the lower portion, making an opening large enough
for a man to slip through.</p>

<p>Some one passed noiselessly through this opening
ahead of him. Frank followed as silently as he could.</p>

<p>Outside he found at his side the one who had entered
the cabin in that manner. This person lay flat
on the ground and moved away with amazing deftness
and silence.</p>

<p>Frank could not follow as easily, but he wormed
along as best he could. In that manner they finally
passed to the shelter of some scrubby bushes.</p>

<p>There Frank found a dark form sitting on the
ground.</p>

<p>"Heap all right," whispered a voice.   "You no make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
a row when Joe him come. Joe he know you be ready
if you find feather."</p>

<p>It was Crowfoot, the faithful old redskin.</p>

<p>"All right now. Make um no noise. Foller Joe,"
continued the Indian.</p>

<p>The old fellow did not hurry. He took his time to
crawl along on hands and knees until they were far
from the hut. At last he arose, and Frank followed
his example. They bent low and went on like two
dark shadows.</p>

<p>"Can we get out of the valley all right?" asked
Merry.</p>

<p>"One man him guard this way to go out," said Joe.</p>

<p>"How do we pass him?"</p>

<p>"Joe know.  Leave it to him."</p>

<p>The valley narrowed at last. They slipped along
between rocky walls. Joe's feet made absolutely no
sound.</p>

<p>"Stop here," advised the redskin. "Joe him come
back in minute."</p>

<p>So Frank stopped and waited. The minute was
long. Indeed, it became ten minutes at least. But the
old fellow returned, saying:</p>

<p>"All right.  Coast clear."</p>

<p>"What's that?" exclaimed Frank, as they nearly
stumbled over a dark figure, as they were hurrying on
again.</p>

<p>"Him guard," said Joe.</p>

<p>"Guard?  What's the matter with him?"</p>

<p>"Him sleep."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Merry shuddered a bit, for he fancied he knew the
sort of sleep meant by the old fellow.</p>

<p>Cimarron Bill would receive his answer in the morning.
It would be a great surprise to him, and would
please him not at all.</p>

<p>More than two miles had been traversed when they
came, in a deep gully, upon old Joe's horse.</p>

<p>"No keep him so near," said the Indian. "Bring
him here to have him ready to-night. You ride."</p>

<p>Frank did not fancy the idea of riding, but the old
fellow insisted, and Merry finally mounted. So they
passed through the silent night, Joe leading for a
time.</p>

<p>"Did you get the package off all right?" Merry
asked.</p>

<p>"Him go," said Joe.  "No worry."</p>

<p>"Joe, I don't know how I can repay you; but anything
I have in this world is yours. You want to
remember that. Take what you want that belongs to
me."</p>

<p>"Joe him not need much. He soon go off to the
long hunt."</p>

<p>Frank thought of the time when this old redskin had
been his bitter enemy, when Joe had seemed treacherous
and deadly as a rattlesnake, and smiled somewhat
over the transformation. He had won the confidence
of the Indian, who was now as faithful as he had
once been dangerous.</p>

<p>"Did you see anything of the one-armed man who
was with my pursuers?" asked Merry.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"No see him after leave you."</p>

<p>"He was sent away to follow you."</p>

<p>"No see him. He no bother me."</p>

<p>Frank was thoroughly well satisfied with the work
of the faithful redskin.</p>

<p>They took turns at riding throughout the night.
Three hours after dawn they came into a large, wooded
valley amid the mountains. As they approached this
valley they heard afar a rumbling, jarring sound that
brought a smile to the face of Frank Merriwell.</p>

<p>"The stamps are in operation," he said.</p>

<p>Riding up the valley, through which flowed a stream
of water, they saw reared against the bold face of a
high mountain, looking like ant-mounds, some buildings,
four or five in number. In the side of the mountain
opened the black mouth of a shaft.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" Merry cried, waving his hat over his
head. "There, Joe, is the Queen Mystery, and it is
in full blast!"</p>

<p>The Queen Mystery mine was located a long distance
from the nearest railroad, but Merriwell had been
to the expense and trouble of having the very latest
machinery brought there and set up. He had in his
employ Jim Tracy, as a foreman, said to be thoroughly
capable and reliable. Only about fifty men were employed
in the mine at that time; but Merry contemplated
increasing the force extensively.</p>

<p>There was talk of a branch railroad being constructed
to pass within ten or fifteen miles of the Queen
Mystery.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Were the mine to fall into the hands of the mining
trust, without doubt that railroad would be constructed,
and it would run direct to Camp Mystery and
onward. The influence of the great railroad magnate
would easily bring about the running of the railroad
to suit his fancy.</p>

<p>The mining trust had been completely baffled in its
first efforts to get the best of Merriwell.</p>

<p>Frank was welcomed at the mine, where he made
himself comfortable.</p>

<p>Old Joe disappeared within six hours after arriving
there. He vanished without saying a word to Merry
about his intentions.</p>

<p>Two days later he reappeared, Frank finding him
sitting, in the morning, with his back against one of
the buildings, his red blanket pulled about him, serenely
smoking.</p>

<p>"Hello, Joe!" cried Merry.  "So you're back?"</p>

<p>"Ugh!" grunted Joe, as he continued to smoke.</p>

<p>"What's your report, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Bad men heap gone."</p>

<p>"Cimarron Bill and his gang?"</p>

<p>"Joe mean um."</p>

<p>"They have gone?"</p>

<p>"Git out. They go heap quick after Strong Heart
he git away."</p>

<p>"Well, that looks as if Bill had given up the fight,
but it seems hardly possible."</p>

<p>"No can tell," said the old fellow. "May come
'gain with great lot many more bad men."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank sat down and talked with the old redskin
for some time. Then Joe was given a square meal,
and he ate heartily.</p>

<p>Merry had some business to look after in the mine,
and he departed, at last, with the idea that he would
find Joe and have another talk with him after the business
was done.</p>

<p>But when Merry came to look again for the Indian,
Joe had disappeared once more in his usual mysterious
fashion.</p>

<p>Merry was not at all satisfied that Cimarron Bill had
given up the struggle. In any event, he was confident
that the syndicate had not given up, and experience
had taught him that the organization would resort to
any desperate means to accomplish its purpose.</p>

<p>So Merriwell, having seen that all things were going
well at the mine, set out the following day for
Holbrook, in which place he mailed a letter to Dick, informing
him of his fortune in escaping from the
ruffians.</p>

<p>In Holbrook Merry purchased a supply of rifles and
cartridges, also small arms. This stock he had boxed
and contracted with a man to deliver everything with
the least possible delay at the Queen Mystery mine.</p>

<p>Having attended to this matter, Merry rested over
night and set out with the first hint of coming day
for the mine.</p>

<p>Through the hottest part of the day he rested in a
ravine where there was some shade. Then he traveled
again until after nightfall.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>The following forenoon found him in a part of the
mountains that seemed familiar. He had diverged
somewhat from the regular trail between Holbrook
and the mine.</p>

<p>Riding through a narrow pass, he came into a valley
that was somewhat wooded and had a decidedly familiar
aspect. Five minutes later he drew rein, uttering
an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>Before him, at a distance, stood an old hut.</p>

<p>It required no second glance to show Merriwell that
it was the very hut where he had been held a captive
by Cimarron Bill and his gang.</p>

<p>Frank looked around keenly, but the valley seemed
desolate, and apparently he and his horse were the only
living creatures within its confines.</p>

<p>"The very place!" said Merry. "I wonder how Bill
liked my answer to his proposition. He must have
been decidedly surprised when he found me missing in
the morning."</p>

<p>He rode forward toward the hut, having a fancy to
look around the place.</p>

<p>As he drew nearer, suddenly his horse plunged forward
and fell, while a shot rang out.</p>

<p>Merry had seen a puff of smoke come from the
window of the hut. He managed to jerk his feet
from the stirrups and drop to the ground behind the
body of the horse, where he lay quite still.</p>

<p>The animal had been shot through the brain, and it
did not even kick after falling.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<h3>MERRIWELL AND BIG MONTE.</h3>


<p>As he lay behind his stricken horse, Merriwell pulled
his rifle around and got it ready for use. Peering over
the body of the animal, he watched the hut.</p>

<p>The sun, which was dropping toward the west, was
still decidedly uncomfortable. It blazed upon him
with a feeling like the heat from a bake-oven.</p>

<p>Frank knew his peril. He knew better than to lift
his head high and give his hidden foe another chance
at him. He could not jump up and rush for cover, as
cover lay too far away. Only one thing could he do,
and that was to remain quietly there and watch and
wait.</p>

<p>After a time it is likely the man who had fired the
shot began to believe Merriwell seriously hurt. Frank
caught a glimpse of him within the hut.</p>

<p>"He's coming out!"  Merry decided.</p>

<p>He was mistaken. Time dragged on and the sun
dipped lower toward the mountain-peaks; but still no
person issued from the old hut. The situation was
anything but comfortable.</p>

<p>"Confound him!" muttered Frank. "Who is he,
and what does he mean?"</p>

<p>Even as he asked the question, he again saw the
man moving beyond the window.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank thrust the rifle across the horse, resting it on
the animal's body. Then he got into a position where
he could take good aim, and then waited again.</p>

<p>The sun was touching the mountain-tops when beyond
the window Merry saw the head of a man.</p>

<p>Then the clear report of his rifle rang through the
valley. The puff of smoke from the muzzle blotted
out the window for a moment. When it floated away
the window was empty.</p>

<p>"Did I reach him?" thought Frank anxiously.</p>

<p>He felt that he had not missed, and still he could
not be sure. He did not venture to rise from behind
the horse. In case he had missed, he might fall before
a second bullet from the hut.</p>

<p>The sun went down behind the mountains, flinging
a hundred golden and crimson banners into the sky.
Finally these began to fade, and a few stars peeped
forth palely.</p>

<p>"If somebody's watching for me there," thought
Merry, "it's going to be dangerous to move, at best."</p>

<p>But something told him his lead had not gone
astray.</p>

<p>As the light faded still more he arose quickly, rifle in
hand, and started on a run for the hut. As he ran
he felt that it was far from impossible that another
shot might bring sudden death to him. Still he did
not hesitate, and, running steadily, he came up to the
hut.</p>

<p>The door swung open before his hand. He looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
in. It was not so dark as to hide a black figure that
lay sprawled on the dirt floor.</p>

<p>Frank shuddered a little, and felt like turning away
at once.</p>

<p>"He brought it on himself!" he whispered. "It was
my life or his. But I'm sorry I had to do it."</p>

<p>Then he entered the hut. Striking a match, he bent
over the prostrate figure. The reflected light, coming
from his hollowed hands, showed him a familiar face.</p>

<p>"Big Monte!" he cried, starting back and dropping
the match.</p>

<p>It was in truth the big man who had been one of
Cimarron Bill's paid satellites.</p>

<p>He found the man's wrist and felt for his pulse.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!"  Merry cried.</p>

<p>Big Monte's pulse flickered beneath his fingers. The
ruffian still lived.</p>

<p>Frank knew where there was some wood, and this
he soon had piled in a little heap in the open fireplace.
He applied a match, and soon a blaze sprang
up.</p>

<p>By the growing light of the fire he examined Monte's
wound.</p>

<p>"Creased him as fine as can be!" he muttered.
"Maybe there is a chance for him, after all."</p>

<p>It may be explained that by "creased" Frank meant
that the bullet had passed along the man's skull, cutting
his scalp, yet had not penetrated the bone. This
had rendered Big Monte unconscious.</p>

<p>Merry removed the fellow's revolvers and knife and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
stood his rifle in a far corner. Then he brought some
water in his drinking-cup and set about the effort of
restoring the wretch to consciousness, which did not
prove such a hard task as he had anticipated.</p>

<p>After a little Monte's eyes opened and he lay staring
at the youth. He seemed bewildered, and it was plain
he could not readily collect his scattered wits.</p>

<p>"Well, Monte," said Frank coolly, "that was a pretty
close call for you. I came near shooting off the top
of your head, which I would have been justified in doing.
All the same, I'm glad I failed."</p>

<p>The big man continued to stare at Frank. Already
Merry had bound up the ruffian's wound.</p>

<p>"Ho!" came hoarsely from Monte's lips. "Back!
Back to the depths! You are dead!"</p>

<p>"If I am dead," said Frank, "I'm just about the
liveliest dead man you ever saw."</p>

<p>A strange smile came to the lips of the wounded
man.</p>

<p>"If you are not yet dead," he said, "I opines you
soon will be a heap."</p>

<p>"Never count chickens before they are hatched,
Monte."</p>

<p>"When you come back you'll find your mine in the
hands of the syndicate. Bill will have it."</p>

<p>"That's interesting! How will Bill get it?"</p>

<p>"He will take it while you are away. He has gathered
a right good gang, and he's a-goin' to jump the
mine to-night."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Monte," said Frank, "you interest me extensively.
How does it happen you are not with the gang?"</p>

<p>"I am one of the watchers. I watch to see that you
do not get back. I reckons I have done my part o'
the job, for I shot you dead a while ago."</p>

<p>The big ruffian was not in his right mind, but already
he had said enough to stir Frank Merriwell's
blood. So Cimarron Bill had been watching his movements
from some place of cover, and had hastened to
gather his ruffians the moment Frank left the mine.
Without doubt Bill had counted on Frank remaining
away longer. However, this night he was to strike,
with his gang. The mine was to be seized.</p>

<p>"I must be there!" muttered Merriwell.</p>

<p>Fortunately Big Monte had a horse hidden not far
from the cabin, and Frank was able to find the animal.</p>

<p>The wounded ruffian was raving at intervals. He
seemed quite deranged.</p>

<p>"I can't leave him like this," thought Merry. "He
might wander off into the mountains and perish."</p>

<p>Still he disliked to be encumbered with the wretch.
Some would have deserted the wounded man without
delay and ridden with all haste to reach the mine.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that such a thought passed
through the head of Frank Merriwell.</p>

<p>"No!" murmured Frank. "He's a human being. It
is my duty to do what I can to save him."</p>

<p>So it came about that two men rode Monte's big
horse away from that valley. One of them muttered,
and laughed, and talked wildly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Riding with the dead!" he said. "We're on the
road to Purgatory! Ha! Ha! Ha! Whip up the
horse! Gallop on!"</p>

<p>It was a strange ride through the starlight night.
The clicking clatter of the horse's hoofs aroused the
big man at intervals, and he laughed and shouted.</p>

<p>"I'm dead!" he finally declared. "I am a dead man!
Two dead men are riding together! And we're on
the road to the burnin' pit! But it's getting a heap
cold! I'm beginnin' to freeze. The fire will be good
an' hot!"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" said Merry. "We're getting near the
Queen Mystery. You may get shot up some more if
you keep your jaw wagging."</p>

<p>As they came nearer to the valley, Merry slackened
the pace of the foam-flecked horse. Fortunately the
animal had been big and strong, for once Frank had
seemed to have little mercy on the beast he bestrode.</p>

<p>Monte continued to talk. He had grown so weak
that Merry was compelled to partly support him.</p>

<p>"Look here," Frank said, in a commanding way,
"you are not to say another word until I give you permission.
Do you understand that?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then close up. Not another word from you."</p>

<p>Monte closed up, obeying like a child.</p>

<p>They were entering the valley. Suddenly there
came a challenge.</p>

<p>"Hold up, thar! Who goes yander?"</p>

<p>Not a word from Merriwell's lips, but he drove the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
spurs to the horse, clutched Big Monte tighter, and
they shot forward into the valley.</p>

<p>Instantly sounded a shot, followed by several more.
Bullets whistled past them. Frank felt Monte give
a great start and lurch sideways, but he held the man
steady.</p>

<p>There were cries of rage from the men who had
fired the shots.</p>

<p>Not a word did Frank speak, but he held straight
on toward the head of the valley and Camp Mystery.</p>

<p>As he approached he saw lights gleaming ahead,
seeming to indicate that the sound of shooting had
come up the valley and aroused the miners.</p>

<p>He was challenged, but gave an answer that caused
the men to welcome him with a shout. It was Crowfoot
who seized the lather-white horse by the bit, but
it was another who caught Big Monte as the ruffian
plunged from the saddle on being released from
Frank's arms.</p>

<p>"I 'lows he'd got it good an' plenty," said the man
who caught Monte. "Ef he ain't dead a'ready, he'll
be so right soon."</p>

<p>"Take him inside somewhere," directed Frank.
"Every man who can find a weapon wants to get ready
to fight. We're going to have a gang of ruffians down
on us here, and we'll have to fight to hold this mine."</p>

<p>"We're all ready, Mr. Merriwell," said Jim Tracy,
the foreman. "Joe Crowfoot came and warned us
what was doin'. I opine them galoots must 'a' bin
shootin' at you some down yander?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's right," said Frank. "I had to ride through
them, and they banged away at me to their satisfaction.
I was lucky to come out with a whole skin."</p>

<p>"Which the other gent didn't. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Big Monte."</p>

<p>"What? Not that galoot? Why, he's one o' the
wust devils unhung in Arizona!"</p>

<p>The men began to murmur.</p>

<p>"Big Monte!" cried another. "Why I has a score
to settle with that thar varmint! He shot my partner,
Luke Brandt."</p>

<p>"An' I has a score to settle with him, too!" declared
another. "He stole a hoss off me!"</p>

<p>Many others claimed grievances against Monte, and
suddenly there was a rush toward the room into which
the wounded man had been conveyed.</p>

<p>Somehow Frank Merriwell was ahead of them all.</p>

<p>As they came crowding in at the door, Merry stood
beside the blanket on which the wounded ruffian was
stretched.</p>

<p>"Hold on, men!" he called quietly. "Monte is dying!"</p>

<p>"What do we keer fer that!" cried one. "All the
more reason fer us to hurry an' swing the varmint
afore he crokes!"</p>

<p>"Let him die in peace."</p>

<p>"That's escapin' what's his due."</p>

<p>Frank lifted one hand.</p>

<p>"There is One above who will judge him," he said.
"It is not for us to do that."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>But those men did not fancy the idea of being
robbed of their vengeance. Big Monte was helpless
in their hands, and they were for swinging him before
he could escape them by giving up the ghost.</p>

<p>"Mr. Merriwell, sir," said one, "we respects you all
right, an' we don't like to run contrarywise to anything
you says here; but in this yere case we has to,
most unfortunate. It is our sollum duty to hang this
onery hoss-thief, an' that is what we proposes to do.
Arter that we'll be ready ter fight fer you an' your
mine as long as it's necessary."</p>

<p>"That's right!" shouted others, as they again
crowded forward. "Let us have him! We'll make it
right short work! Then we'll be ready fer his pards!"</p>

<p>Some of them flourished weapons. They were an
ugly-looking crew.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash Frank Merriwell whipped out a
pair of revolvers and leveled them at the crowd.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "I have just one thing to observe:
If you don't, one and all, get out of here instanter
and leave Monte to shuffle off in peace I shall
open on you! If I open on you, I shall reduce you so
that Cimarron Bill and his crowd will have no trouble
whatever in taking this mine."</p>

<p>They did not doubt but he meant it, remarkable
though it seemed. If they attempted to seize Monte,
Merriwell would begin shooting. It was astonishing
that he should choose to defend this ruffian that had
been one of his worst enemies.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>As the men were hesitating, old Joe Crowfoot suddenly
appeared.</p>

<p>"Com'ron Bill he come!" said the Indian. "There
be a heap fight in a minute! Come quick!"</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried Jim Tracy.</p>

<p>And the men rushed forth to meet and repulse Cimarron
Bill and his gang.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<h3>THE DEATH-SHOT.</h3>


<p>Frank was about to follow, when Big Monte
clutched weakly at his foot.</p>

<p>"Pard," said the ruffian, "I may never git another
chanct to say it. You're the white stuff! They'd shore
hanged me a whole lot but for you. Now I has
a chanct to die comfortable an' respectable like.
Thankee, Frank Merriwell."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it!" said Frank. "Die as comfortably
as you can. I have to go out to help the boys
shoot a few of your pards."</p>

<p>"I ain't got northin' agin' them," said Monte; "but
I wishes ye luck. They're in the wrong, an' you're
right."</p>

<p>At this moment the sound of shooting outside
startled Merry, and, without another word, he rushed
forth, leaving Monte lying there.</p>

<p>Cimarron Bill had counted on capturing the mine
by strategy and meeting with very little resistance.
When Frank had returned and ridden into the valley
Bill knew that it would not do to delay longer, and he
had led his men in swift pursuit.</p>

<p>But old Joe Crowfoot, faithful as ever, had prepared
the miners for the attack; so it came about that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the ruffians were met with a volley of lead that dismayed
and demoralized them. This was not the kind
of work they relished.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Frank Merriwell came hurrying
forth, only to find the enemy already repulsed and
retreating in disorder.</p>

<p>The starlight showed two men and a horse stretched
on the ground, while another horse was hobbling about.
At a distance down the valley the mine-seizers were
fleeing.</p>

<p>"They git heap hot time!" said old Joe, in Frank's
ear.</p>

<p>"What?" cried Merry. "Have they quit it as quick
as this?"</p>

<p>"It looks that way, sir," said Jim Tracy.</p>

<p>"And I didn't get into the game."</p>

<p>"You was too busy defending Big Monte. I hopes
you pardons me, sir, but I thinks that was a mistake."</p>

<p>"You have a right to think whatever you like, but
I object to your freedom in expressing yourself."</p>

<p>This was plain enough, and it told Tracy that Frank
would not tolerate any criticism from him.</p>

<p>"It's your own game," muttered Tracy, turning
away.</p>

<p>"I see you have dropped two of those chaps."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Revolver in hand, Frank walked out toward the spot
where the two figures lay. He was followed by Crowfoot
and several others.</p>

<p>The first man was stone-dead.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>The next proved to be the Mexican, Pinto Pede, who
was sorely wounded.</p>

<p>"That cursed greaser!" growled one of the men.
"Give me lief to finish him, Mr. Merriwell!"</p>

<p>He placed the muzzle of a pistol against Pede's head.</p>

<p>Frank knew that a word from him would send the
Mexican into eternity.</p>

<p>"None of that!" he said sternly and commandingly.
"Pick the fellow up and take him in yonder. He may
not be shot up too bad to recover."</p>

<p>But they drew back.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Tracy, "I don't opine thar is a man here
but what thinks hisself too good to be after handlin'
the onery greaser."</p>

<p>"And you would let him remain here to die?"</p>

<p>"I reckons that's correct."</p>

<p>In another moment Merry had stooped and lifted the
slender body of Pinto Pede in his arms. With long
strides, he bore the Mexican toward the building in
which Big Monte lay.</p>

<p>The miners looked on in amazement.</p>

<p>"Waal, he's the limit!" said Jim Tracy, in disgust.</p>

<p>Crowfoot followed Frank, who took Pede into the
room and placed him beside Big Monte. The redskin
stopped at the door, where he stood on guard.</p>

<p>"Well, Pede," said Frank, "we'll examine and see
just how hard you're hit."</p>

<p>The Mexican was shot in the side. At first it
seemed that the wound might be fatal, but, examining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
with the skill of an amateur surgeon, Frank made a
discovery.</p>

<p>"She struck a rib, Pede," he said. "She followed
around and came out here. Why, you're not in such a
bad way! You may pull through this thing all right.
You'd be almost sure to if you had the right sort of
treatment."</p>

<p>The Mexican said nothing, but certain it is that he
was bewildered when he found Merry dressing the
wound. This Frank did with such skill as he possessed,
making the fellow comfortable.</p>

<p>Big Monte had watched all this, and he spoke for
the first time when the job was done.</p>

<p>"I reckon," he said, "that they don't raise galoots
like you ev'rywhere. Why, it shore was up to you
to finish the two o' us! Why you didn't do it is
something I don't understand none at all. An' you
keeps them gents from takin' me out an' swingin' me.
You shore air plenty diffrunt from any one I ever
meets up with afore!"</p>

<p>Old Joe Crowfoot had been watching everything.
The Indian understood Frank not at all, but whatever
"Strong Heart" did Joe was ready to stand by.</p>

<p>"Don't worry over it," laughed Merry. "I owe you
something, Monte."</p>

<p>"I fail to see what."</p>

<p>"Why, you warned me that Bill and the others
meant to jump the mine to-night."</p>

<p>"Did I?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't remember. But I tried ter shoot ye. Bill
said you was ter be shot ef you comes a-hustlin' back
afore he gits around to doin' his part o' the job."</p>

<p>"You got the worst of it in that little piece of shooting,
so we'll call that even."</p>

<p>"If you says even, I'm more'n willin'."</p>

<p>"Now," said Frank, "I'm going out with the men
to watch for a second attack from Bill. I have to
leave you, and some of the boys may take a fancy to
hang you, after all. That bein' the case, I don't want
to leave you so you won't have a show. Here, take this
gun. With it you may be able to defend yourself until
I can reach you. But don't shoot any one if you
can help it, for after that I don't believe even I could
save you."</p>

<p>So he placed a revolver in the hand of Big Monte
and went out, leaving the wounded ruffians together.</p>

<p>When Frank was gone the two wounded wretches
lay quite still for some time. Finally Pinto Pede
stirred and looked at Big Monte.</p>

<p>"How you get shot?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The gent who jest went out done a part o' the
job," said Monte, in reply.</p>

<p>"Heem&mdash;he shoot you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ha! You lik' da chance to shoot heem?"</p>

<p>"Waal, I had it, but I missed him. He fooled me
a whole lot, fer he jest kept still behind his hoss, what
I had salted, an' then he got in at me with his own
bit o' lead."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"That mak' you hate heem! Now you want to keel
heem?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know! I don't opine I'm so mighty
eager."</p>

<p>"Beel says he gif one thousan' dol' to man who shoot
Frank Mer'well."</p>

<p>"That's a good lot."</p>

<p>"Beel he do it."</p>

<p>"No doubt o' that, I reckons."</p>

<p>"Mebbe you an' I haf the chance."</p>

<p>"Waal, not fer me! I quits! When a chap keeps
my neck from bein' stretched arter all I has done ter
him&mdash;waal, that settles it! I opines I has a leetle humanity
left in me. An' he thought I was dyin', too. I
kinder thought so then, but I'm managin' ter pull
along. Mebbe I'll come through."</p>

<p>The face of Pinto Pede showed that he was thinking
black thoughts.</p>

<p>"Gif me da chance!" he finally said. "You no haf
to do eet. Gif me da chance. I do eet, an' we divvy
da mon'. Ha?"</p>

<p>"Don't count me into your deviltry."</p>

<p>"No count you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What matter? You no too good. I see you shoot
man in back."</p>

<p>"Mebbe you did; but he hadn't kept me from bein'
lynched."</p>

<p>"Bah! Why he do eet? You fool! He want to
turn you ofer to law."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mebbe you're right; I don't know."</p>

<p>"You safe yourself if you help keel him."</p>

<p>"Looker hyer, Pede, I'm a low-down onery skunk;
but I reckon thar's a limit even fer me. I've struck it.
This hyer Frank Merriwell made me ashamed a' myself
fer the fust time in a right long time. I know
I'm too onery to reform an' ever be anything decent,
even if I don't shuffle off with these two wounds. All
the same, I ain't the snake ter turn an' soak pisen
inter Merriwell, an' you hear me. Others may do it,
but not Big Monte."</p>

<p>"Bah! All right! You not get half! Yes; you
keep steel, you get eet."</p>

<p>"What are you driving at?"</p>

<p>"Wait. Mebbe you see. All you haf to do is keep
steel."</p>

<p>"Waal, I'm great at keepin' still," said Monte.</p>

<p>It was not far from morning when Merriwell re-entered
that room.</p>

<p>Pinto Pede seemed to be sleeping, but Big Monte
was wide-awake.</p>

<p>"Hello!" exclaimed Frank. "So you're still on
these shores. I didn't know but you had sailed out."</p>

<p>"Pard, I opine mebbe I may git well enough to
be hanged, after all," grinned the big ruffian.</p>

<p>"Possibly you may," said Frank. "And the chances
are you would be if I were to leave you alone long
enough. I heard some of the boys talking. They
contemplate taking you out and doing things to you
after I'm asleep. But they did not reckon that I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
come here to sleep, where they cannot get their hands
on you without disturbing me."</p>

<p>"That was right kind of you," said Monte. "How's
Bill?"</p>

<p>"I think that Bill has had his fill for the present.
Indications are that he has left the valley with his
whole force, and we are not looking for further
trouble from him in some time to come."</p>

<p>"Bill shore found hisself up against the real thing,"
said Monte.</p>

<p>Frank placed a blanket near the door, wrapped himself
in it, and was soon sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>Big Monte seemed to fall asleep after a time.</p>

<p>Finally the Mexican lifted his head and listened.
He looked at Monte, and then at Frank. Seeming to
satisfy himself, he gently dropped aside his blanket
and began creeping across the floor, making his way toward
Merriwell. He moved with the silence of a
serpent.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that Big Monte was not asleep,
although he had seemed to be. The Mexican had not
crept half the distance to Frank when the big man
turned slightly, lifted his head, and watched. As the
creeping wretch drew nearer to the sleeping youth the
hand of Big Monte was gently thrust out from the
folds of his blanket.</p>

<p>Pede reached Frank, and then arose to his knees.
Suddenly he lifted above his head a deadly knife,
which he meant to plunge into the breast of the unconscious
sleeper.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>At that instant a spout of fire leaped from something
in the hand which Big Monte had thrust from
beneath the blanket, and with the crashing report of
the revolver Pede fell forward across the body of his
intended victim, shot through the brain!</p>

<p>Frank was on his feet in an instant.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he cried, astounded, stirring
the body of the Mexican with his foot.</p>

<p>"You gave me a gun," said Big Monte, "so that I
might defend myself. It came in handy when I saw
Pede gittin' keerless with his knife an' goin' fer to cut
you up."</p>

<p>"Was that it?" exclaimed Frank. "Why, he was
going to stab me! And you saved my life by shooting
him!"</p>

<p>"Which mebbe makes us some nearer square than
we was," said Monte, "as you saved my life a leetle
time ago."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<h3>FRANK MAKES A DECISION.</h3>


<p>Frank leaned against the door-jamb of his cabin and
looked out into the sunny valley. To his ears came
the roar of the stamp-mills of the mine, which was in
full blast. Before him lay the mine-buildings about
the mouth of the tunnel, from which rich ore was being
brought to be fed to the greedy stamps.</p>

<p>It was now something like ten days since the ruffians
under Cimarron Bill tried to carry the mine by assault.</p>

<p>Frank had remained watchful and alert, well knowing
the nature of Cimarron Bill and believing he
would not be content to abandon the effort thus easily.
Still the second attack, which he had so fully expected,
had not come.</p>

<p>He was wondering now if the ruffians had given it
up. Or had they been instructed by the trust to turn
their attention to the San Pablo Mine?</p>

<p>If the latter was the case, Frank felt that they would
find the San Pablo prepared. He had taken pains before
hastening to the Queen Mystery to fortify his
mine in Mexico, leaving it in charge of a man whom
he fully trusted.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Frank felt that it would be far better
were he able to personally watch both mines at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
same time. Just now he was meditating on the advisability
of leaving the Queen Mystery and journeying
southward to the San Pablo.</p>

<p>As he thought this matter over, something seemed
to whisper in his ear that such an action on his part
was anticipated by the enemy, who were waiting for
him to make the move. Then, while he was away,
they would again descend on the Queen Mystery.</p>

<p>Again the old Indian, Crowfoot, had disappeared,
after his usual manner, without telling Frank whither
he was going. Merry knew he might be in the vicinity,
or he might be hundreds of miles away. Still,
Joe had a remarkable faculty of turning up just when
he was most needed.</p>

<p>Merry turned back into the little cabin, leaving the
door open. He had been feeling of his chin as he
stood in the doorway, and now he thought:</p>

<p>"A shave will clean me up. Great Scott! but I'm
getting a beard! This shaving is becoming a regular
nuisance."</p>

<p>Indeed, Frank was getting a beard. Every day it
seemed to grow heavier and thicker, and he found it
necessary to shave frequently to maintain that clean
appearance in which he so greatly delighted.</p>

<p>Frank could wear old clothes, he could rough it with
joy, he minded neither wind nor weather, but personal
cleanliness he always maintained when such a thing
was in any manner possible. To him a slovenly person
was offensive. He pitied the man or boy who
did not know the pleasure of being clean, and he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
it was possible for any one to be clean, no matter what
his occupation, provided he could obtain a cake of
soap and sufficient water.</p>

<p>So Frank was shaving every day when possible. He
now turned back into the cabin and brought out his
shaving-set. On the wall directly opposite the open
door hung a small square mirror, with a narrow shelf
below it.</p>

<p>Here Merry made preparations for his shaving.
Over a heater-lamp he prepared his water, whistling
the air of the Boola Song. This tune made him think
of his old friends of Yale, some of whom he had not
heard from for some time.</p>

<p>A year had not yet passed since he had gathered
them and taken his baseball-team into the Mad River
region to play baseball. In that brief space of time
many things had occurred which made it evident that
never again could they all be together for sport. The
days of mere sport were past and over; the days of
serious business had come.</p>

<p>Frank thought, with a sense of sadness, of Old Eli.
Before him rose a vision of the campus buildings, in
his ears sounded the laughter and songs, and he saw
the line of fellows hanging on the fence, smoking
their pipes and chaffing good-naturedly.</p>

<p>With some men it is a sad thing that they cannot
look back with any great degree of pleasure on their
boyhood and youth. They remember that other boys
seemed to have fine times, while they did not. Later,
other youths chummed together and were hail-fellow-well-met,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
while they seemed set aloof from these jolly
associates. With Frank this was not so. He remembered
his boyhood with emotions of the greatest pleasure,
from the time of his early home life to his bidding
farewell to Fardale. Beyond that even unto this
day the joy of life made him feel that it was a million
fold worth living.</p>

<p>There are thousands who confess that they would
not be willing to go back and live their lives over.
Had the question been put to Frank Merriwell he
would have said that nothing could give him greater
pleasure.</p>

<p>When the water was hot, Frank carefully applied
his razor to the strop and made it sharp enough for
his purpose. Then he arranged everything needed
on the little shelf beneath the mirror.</p>

<p>Now, it is impossible to say what thing it was that
led him to remove his revolver from the holster and
place it on the shelf with the other things, but something
caused him to do so.</p>

<p>Then he applied the lather to his face, and was
about to use the razor, when he suddenly saw something
in the mirror that led him to move with amazing
quickness.</p>

<p>Behind him, at the open door, was a man with a
rifle. This man, a bearded ruffian, had crept up to
the door with the weapon held ready for use.</p>

<p>But for the fact that the interior of the cabin seemed
somewhat gloomy to the eyes of the man, accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
as they were to the bright glare of the sun outside, he
might have been too swift for Frank.</p>

<p>Another thing added to Frank's fortune, and it was
that he had drawn his revolver and placed the weapon
on the little shelf in front of him. For this reason it
was not necessary for him to reach toward the holster
at his hip, an action which must have hurried the ruffian
to the attempted accomplishment of his murderous
design. For Merriwell had no doubt of the fellow's
intention. He saw murder in the man's eyes and
pose.</p>

<p>The rifle was half-lifted. In another moment
Frank Merriwell would have been shot in the back in
a most dastardly manner.</p>

<p>He snatched the revolver from the little shelf and
fired over his shoulder without turning his head, securing
such aim as was possible by the aid of the
mirror into which he was looking. Frank had learned
to shoot in this manner, and he could do so as skilfully
as many of the expert marksmen who gave exhibitions
of fancy shooting throughout the country.</p>

<p>His bullet struck the hand of the man, smashing
some of the ruffian's fingers and causing him to drop
the rifle.</p>

<p>Merry wheeled and strode to the door, his smoking
revolver in his hand, a terrible look in his eyes.</p>

<p>The wretch was astounded by what had happened.
Blood was streaming from his wounded hand. He
saw Merriwell confront him with the ready pistol.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"You treacherous cur!" said Frank indignantly.
"I think I'll finish you!"</p>

<p>He seemed about to shoot the man down, whereupon
the ruffian dropped on his knees, begging for
mercy.</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;don't shoot!" he gasped, holding up his
bleeding hand, "Don't kill me!"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I? You meant to kill me."</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;I swear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't lie! Your soul may start on its long trail
in a moment! Don't lie when you may be on the brink
of eternity!"</p>

<p>These stern words frightened the fellow more than
ever.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm telling you the truth&mdash;I sw'ar I am!" he
hastened to say.</p>

<p>"You crept up to this door all ready to fill me full
of lead."</p>

<p>"No, no! Nothing of the sort! I was not looking
for you! It&mdash;it was some one else! I swear it by my
honor!"</p>

<p>A bitter smile curled the lips of the young man.</p>

<p>"Honor!" he said&mdash;"your honor! Never mind.
How much were you to receive for killing me?"</p>

<p>"It was not you; it was another man."</p>

<p>"What other?"</p>

<p>"Tracy."</p>

<p>"My foreman?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were looking for him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Him and me have had a fallin' out, and he cussed
me. He threatened to shoot me, too."</p>

<p>"What was the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he didn't like the way I done my work. It's
true; ask him. I swore I'd fix him."</p>

<p>"Well, what brought you here to my cabin to shoot
the foreman?"</p>

<p>"I thought I saw him coming this way."</p>

<p>Frank pressed his lips together and looked the man
over. Somehow he believed the ruffian was lying, in
spite of all these protests.</p>

<p>"See here, Anson," he said, "you were hired by the
mining trust, or by some of its tools, to shoot me,
and you tried to earn your money. Don't deny it, for
you can't fool me. Just own up to the truth and it
will be better for you. Tell me who made the deal
with you and how much you were to receive. If you
come out honestly and confess all, I'll spare you. Your
hand is bleeding pretty bad, and it should be attended
to at once. I'll see to that, but upon condition that
you confess."</p>

<p>Still the ruffian continued to protest, insisting that it
was Tracy he was looking for. In the midst of this he
suddenly stopped, seeming to be badly frightened.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" he choked. "Here comes Tracy!
Don't tell him! I can't defend myself! Don't tell
him, or he'll sure shoot me up and finish me!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim Tracy was coming with long strides. He saw
Frank and the wretch with the bleeding hand.</p>

<p>"Whatever is this?" he demanded. "I heard the
shooting. What has this yaller dog been up to?"</p>

<p>"I shot him," said Frank quietly. "He came walking
into my door in a careless manner with his rifle
in his hand, and I shot him in a hurry. He was foolish;
he should have been more careful. It's dangerous
to walk in on me that way, even with the most peaceable
intentions."</p>

<p>There was a strange look on Tracy's face.</p>

<p>"So that's how it happened?" he exclaimed, in a
harsh voice. "Well, it's pretty certain that Hop Anson
needs to have his worthless neck stretched, and all
I ask is permission to attend to the job. I'll dispose of
him very quickly."</p>

<p>"I told you, Mr. Merriwell!" muttered the wounded
man.</p>

<p>"You have had some trouble with him, have you,
Tracy?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"Confound his hide! yes, I have. He has no business
here at this time. His place is discharging the
rock as it comes out. The fact that he's here counts
against him. Turn him over to me."</p>

<p>"Instead of that," said Frank, thrusting his revolver
into his holster, "I think I'll take care of him.
Come in here, Anson."</p>

<p>Tracy seemed astonished and disgusted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm going to see if I can't dress that hand and
keep him from bleeding to death," was Merriwell's
answer.</p>

<p>"Well, by thunder!" muttered the foreman.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<h3>MERRIWELL'S METHOD.</h3>


<p>It was not easy for such men to understand Frank
Merriwell. Hop Anson was as much astonished as
was Jim Tracy. He entered the cabin at Frank's
command, and Merriwell proceeded to wash and examine the wound.</p>

<p>"You'll have to lose two fingers and part of another
one," said Merriwell. "I can do the job for you right
here, if you say so. Or I'll patch them up, stop the
bleeding, and let you get to a regular saw-bones."</p>

<p>"You go ahead," said Anson.</p>

<p>So Frank opened a trunk which sat behind a curtain
in one corner of the room, bringing out a case,
which, on being opened, revealed a complete set of surgical
instruments. These he spread out on the rough
table, and soon he was ready to operate on Hop Anson's
mangled hand.</p>

<p>Jim Tracy, his hands on his hips and his feet rather
wide apart, stood looking on in silence.</p>

<p>Frank spent the greater part of an hour about his
task, impressing Tracy as an assistant, and when he
had finished two of the ruffian's fingers and a part of
the third were gone, but the amputation and dressing
had been done in a manner that was anything but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
bungling. Frank had been as careful as possible to
preserve cleanliness about his work.</p>

<p>"Well, you're certain a wonder!" exclaimed Tracy
admiringly. "But you makes a big mistake in wastin'
so much trouble on a dog like this."</p>

<p>Anson did not retort, save with a sullen flash of his
treacherous eyes in the direction of the foreman.</p>

<p>"Permit me to know my business, Tracy," said
Merry shortly. "You may go now, Anson."</p>

<p>"What? You're not going to let him go where he
likes?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>So Hop Anson walked out of the cabin, picked up
his rifle, and disappeared.</p>

<p>"I don't want to criticise you, Mr. Merriwell," said
the foreman. "You know I am devoted to your interests.
But I feel confident that you will be very sorry
you treated that man in such a decent way and then
let him off. He's a snake. I still believe he crept up
to the door to shoot you in the back."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he did," nodded Frank, cleansing his instruments
with the utmost coolness. "If so, he got the
worst of it."</p>

<p>"But would you let him off like that if you knew it
was so?"</p>

<p>"No. He swore it was not. I had no proof, so I
let him go."</p>

<p>"You're altogether too easy with your enemies,"
asserted Tracy. "Just you turn them over to me. I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
take care of them, and they'll never bother you again,
be right sure of that."</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," smiled Frank, returning the instruments
to the case.</p>

<p>"You came mighty near being killed by that greaser
because you were easy with him."</p>

<p>"And my life was saved by Big Monte because I
had been easy with him. That balances things, I fancy.
In fact, for me, it more than balances things. I'd
rather let a dozen bad men escape punishment than
strike one who is innocent."</p>

<p>"But neither Big Monte nor Pinto Pede was innocent."</p>

<p>"And Pinto Pede provided a subject with which to
start a graveyard here. Big Monte seemed repentant.
Pede would have knifed me, but Monte shot him just
as he was ready to strike."</p>

<p>"Well, where's Big Monte now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," confessed Frank.</p>

<p>"He skipped out."</p>

<p>"Sure thing. He took a walk the first chance he
got."</p>

<p>"And it's certain he's gone back to his pals. When
they strike at you ag'in, if they do, Monte will be
with 'em."</p>

<p>"All right. Perhaps he has an idea he'll be fighting
fair that way."</p>

<p>"And he may kill you yet."</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"Well," said Tracy, "I must admit that I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
understand you none whatever! Hop Anson left his
work, got a rifle and came sneakin' up to your door.
You shoots him in the hand, then doctors him and lets
him go. That's right peculiar. But I have him to deal
with somewhat, and I propose to deal. If you hear
before night that Hop has hopped the divide don't be
any surprised."</p>

<p>Tracy seemed about to depart.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Frank, "before you go, I have
some things to say. Unless Hop Anson gives you
good and sufficient cause, you are not to lift your hand
against him. I don't want any shooting to get started
here at the mine. I want these men to dwell together
peaceably. The first shooting is likely to lead to other
work in the same line."</p>

<p>"You're too much against such things," said Tracy;
"and still I notice you don't hesitate any whatever to
use a gun at times."</p>

<p>"When forced to it; never at any other time. I
am decidedly against it. It would be dead easy to start
an affair here that would lead to disturbances that
might get the men to quarreling. That would put the
men in condition to revolt, and an assault upon the
mine would find us weakened. I trust you, Tracy, to
be careful about this matter. Much depends on you.
You have proved satisfactory in every way."</p>

<p>"Thankee," said the foreman, somewhat awkwardly.
"I've tried to do my best, sir."</p>

<p>"That is all I ask of any man. That is all any man
can do. You should understand why I wish no disturbance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
But, at the same time, let me warn you to
watch Hop Anson closely&mdash;for your own benefit. If
you have to do any shooting, well and good."</p>

<p>"I think I understand," said Tracy, as he walked
out. At the door he paused and half-turned, as if to
say something more. Already Frank was facing the
little mirror on the wall, ready to resume his shaving.
He stood exactly as he had stood when he shot at
Anson, and his revolver lay on the shelf beneath the
mirror.</p>

<p>Tracy went on.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<h3>SMOKE SIGNALS AND A DECOY.</h3>


<p>Frank grew restless. On the day following the
shooting of Anson he called Tracy and said:</p>

<p>"Tracy, I want you to keep your eyes open and be
on your guard while I am away."</p>

<p>"Are you going away, sir?" asked the foreman.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"For a long time?"</p>

<p>"That is uncertain. I may return by night, and I
may not be back for several days."</p>

<p>The foreman looked as if he wished to ask where
Frank thought of going, but held himself in check.</p>

<p>"I wish to satisfy myself if any of my enemies are
in this vicinity," said Merriwell. "I leave things in
your hands here, and I believe I can trust you."</p>

<p>"You can, sir, fully."</p>

<p>Merry attended to the saddling of his horse. When
he rode forth from the mine he was well armed and
prepared for almost anything. Behind him the roar
of the ore-crushers died out, and he passed into the
silence of the mountains.</p>

<p>Not an hour had passed when he was somewhat surprised
to see before him from an elevated point a big,
ball-like cloud of dark smoke rising into the sky.</p>

<p>"That's odd," was his immediate decision.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped his horse and watched the smoke as it
ascended and grew thinner. It was followed by another
ball of smoke as he watched, and after this came
still another.</p>

<p>Then Frank turned in the saddle, looking in various
directions. Some miles behind him three distinct and
separate clouds of smoke seemed to be mounting into
the sky from another high elevation.</p>

<p>"If those are not smoke signals," said Frank, "I'm
a chump! In that case, it's likely I'll have Indians to
deal with if I keep on. Perhaps I'd better turn back."</p>

<p>For something told him that he was the object of
those signals, and this was an Indian method of communication.
He sat still for some time, watching the
smoke fade in the upper air, which it did slowly. At
last, however, it was gone, and the clear atmosphere
held no black signal of danger.</p>

<p>Frank's curiosity was aroused. He longed to know
the meaning of those signals. Having looked to his
weapons, he rode on slowly, keenly on the alert.</p>

<p>Coming through a narrow gorge into a valley that
looked barren enough, he suddenly snatched forth a
revolver and cried:</p>

<p>"Halt, there! Stop, or&mdash;&mdash;Why, it's a woman!"</p>

<p>For he had seen a figure hastily seeking concealment
amid some boulders. At sound of his voice the figure
straightened up and turned toward him.</p>

<p>Then he was more amazed than ever, for he saw a
dark-faced Mexican girl, wearing a short skirt and
having about her neck a scarlet handkerchief. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
head was bare, and her dark hair fell over her shoulders.
She looked like a frightened fawn.</p>

<p>No wonder he was astonished to behold such a
vision in that desolate part of the mountains. She
seemed trembling, yet eager, and she started to advance
toward him.</p>

<p>"Oh, señor!" she said, in a voice that was full of
soft music, "eet mus' be you are good man! Eet mus'
be you are not bad an' weeked. You would not hurt
Gonchita?"</p>

<p>"Not on your life!" exclaimed Merry, at once putting
up his revolver.</p>

<p>At which she came running and panting up to him,
all in a flutter of excitement.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Madre de Dios</i>! I am so much happeeness!
I have de great fear when you I do see. Oh, you weel
come to heem? You weel do for heem de saveeng?"</p>

<p>The girl was rather pretty, and she was not more
than eighteen or nineteen years of age. She was
tanned to a dark brown, but had white teeth, which
were strangely pointed and sharp.</p>

<p>"Who do you mean?"</p>

<p>"My fadare. <i>Ay-de mi</i>! he ees hurt! De bad men
shoot heem. They rob heem! He find de gold. He
breeng me with heem here to de mountain, all alone.
He theenk some time he be vera reech. He have de
reech mine. Then de bad men come. They shoot
heem. They take hees gold. He come creep back to
me. What can I to do? <i>Ay-de mi</i>!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your father&mdash;some bad men have shot him?" said
Merry.</p>

<p>"<i>Si, si, señor</i>!"</p>

<p>"It must have been Cimarron Bill's gang," thought
Merry.</p>

<p>The girl was greatly excited, but he continued to
question her, until he understood her quite well.</p>

<p>"Is he far from here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, not de very far. You come to heem? Mebbe
you do for heem some good. Weel you come?"</p>

<p>She had her brown hands clasped and was looking
most beseechingly into Frank's face.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll come," he said. "You shall show
me the way. My horse will carry us both."</p>

<p>He assisted her to mount behind him, and told her
to cling about his waist.</p>

<p>Frank continued to question Gonchita, who sometimes
became almost unintelligible in her excitement
and distress. They passed through the valley and
turned into a rocky gorge. Frank asked if it was
much farther.</p>

<p>"We be almost to heem now," assured Gonchita.</p>

<p>Almost as the words left her lips the heads of four
or five men appeared above some boulders just ahead,
and as many rifles were leveled straight at Frank's
heart, while a well-known, triumphant voice shouted:</p>

<p>"I've got you dead to rights, Merriwell! If you
tries tricks you gits soaked good and plenty!"</p>

<p>At the same moment the girl threw her arms about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Frank's body, pinning his arms to his sides, so that he
could make no move to draw a weapon.</p>

<p>Merry knew on the instant that he had been trapped.
He realized that he had been decoyed into the snare
by the Mexican girl. He might have struggled and
broken her hold, but he realized the folly of such an
attempt.</p>

<p>"Be vera steel, señor!" hissed the voice of Gonchita
in his ear. "Eet be bet-are."</p>

<p>"You have betrayed me," said Frank reproachfully.
"I did not think it of you. And I was ready to do
you a service."</p>

<p>He said no more to her.</p>

<p>Out from the rocks stepped Cimarron Bill.</p>

<p>"So we meet again, my gay young galoot," said the
chief of the ruffians. "An' I reckon you'll not slip
me so easy this time. That old Injun o' yours is food
fer buzzards, an' so he won't give ye no assistance
whatever."</p>

<p>"Old Joe&mdash;&mdash;" muttered Merry, in dismay.</p>

<p>"Oh, we finished him!" declared Bill. "That's why
you ain't seen him fer some time. Set stiddy, now, an'
don't make no ruction.</p>

<p>"Gonchita, toss down his guns."</p>

<p>The Mexican girl obeyed, slipping to the ground
with a laugh when she had disarmed Frank.</p>

<p>The ruffians now came out from the shelter of the
rocks and gathered about the youth, grinning at him
in a most provoking manner. He recognized several
of the same fellows who had once before acted as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
guard over him. Red Sam was there, and nodded to
him.</p>

<p>"You're a right slick poker-player," said the sandy
rascal; "but we 'lowed a girl'd fool ye easy. Goncheeter
done it, too."</p>

<p>Frank nodded.</p>

<p>"She did," he confessed. "I was taken off my
guard. But you want to look out for Indians."</p>

<p>"Why for?"</p>

<p>Merry then told them of the smoke signals, whereupon
they grinned at one another knowingly.</p>

<p>"That'll be all right," said Bill. "Them signals told
us when you was comin', an' which way."</p>

<p>"Then you were doing the signaling?"</p>

<p>"Some o' the boys."</p>

<p>Frank was then ordered down and searched. He
appeared utterly fearless. He observed that Gonchita
was watching him closely, a strange look in her eyes,
her lips slightly parted, showing her milky, pointed
teeth.</p>

<p>When the men were satisfied that no weapon remained
in the possession of their captive, two or three
of them drew aside to consult, while the others guarded
Frank.</p>

<p>Cimarron Bill patted Gonchita's cheek with his hand.</p>

<p>"Well done, leetle gal!" he said. "You fooled him
powerful slick."</p>

<p>She smiled into Bill's eyes, but in another moment,
the chief, having turned away, she was watching
Frank again.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>The result of the consultation led to the placing of
Merry on his own horse, and he was guarded by the
armed men who escorted him along the gorge until
they came to a place where two men were watching a
number of waiting horses.</p>

<p>Then there was mounting and riding away, with
Frank in the midst of his triumphant enemies. Gonchita
rode with them, having a wiry little pony that
seemed able to cope with any of the other horses.</p>

<p>Frank was not a little disgusted because he had
been decoyed into the trap, but he did his best to hide
his feelings.</p>

<p>It was some hours later that they halted to rest until
the heat of the day should pass. A fire was built,
and a meal prepared, Gonchita taking active part in
this work.</p>

<p>Frank sat near and watched all that was passing.
He had not been bound, and his manner was that of
one free amid the scoundrels by whom he was surrounded.
It was Gonchita who found an opportunity
to whisper in his ear:</p>

<p>"Be vera careful! Dey mean to shoot you eef you
try de escape."</p>

<p>He did not start or betray any emotion whatever.
It hardly seemed that he had heard her whispered
words. Later, however, he gave her a look which
conveyed to her the assurance that he had not failed
to understand.</p>

<p>As she worked about the fire she called upon him to
replenish it with more fuel, which he did. He was putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
wood on the fire when she again whispered to
him:</p>

<p>"I weel drop by you a peestol. Tak' eet; you may
need eet."</p>

<p>He made no retort, but watched for her to keep
her promise, which she afterward found opportunity
to do.</p>

<p>Merry was lying carelessly on the ground when the
weapon, a tiny revolver, was dropped at his side. Immediately
he rolled over upon his stomach, in a lazy
fashion, hiding the weapon, and shortly after he succeeded
in slipping it into his pocket.</p>

<p>Frank wondered how this strange girl happened to
be with those ruffians. It seemed a most remarkable
and mysterious thing. He also wondered why she
had been led to give him the pistol. Having led him
into the trap, she had suddenly changed so that she
now seemed to wish him to escape without harm.</p>

<p>The truth was that his coolness and nerve, together
with his handsome, manly appearance, had quite won
Gonchita's heart. She was a changeable creature, and
had quickly come to regret leading this handsome youth
into such a snare.</p>

<p>When the food was prepared all partook heartily.
Two of the men, a big fellow with an evil face, called
Brazos Tom, and a thick-shouldered brute hailed as
Mike Redeye, had been drinking freely from a flask.
Brazos Tom was given to chaffing the others in a manner
that some of them did not appreciate, and this inclination
grew upon him with the working of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
liquor. Redeye was a sullen, silent fellow, and Frank
regarded him as a very dangerous man.</p>

<p>Once or twice Cimarron Bill gave Tom a look, and,
at last, the big fellow seemed to quiet down.</p>

<p>After the meal, while the men were yet resting, Bill
had his horse saddled for some reason, and rode away,
having left the men in charge of Red Sam.</p>

<p>As soon as the chief was gone, Brazos Tom brought
forth his flask, which was now nearly emptied.</p>

<p>"Gents," he said, "while we is waitin' we'll finish
this an' try a hand at poker. Wot d'yer say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, blazes!" growled one. "You an' Mike has
purt' near finished that. Thar ain't enough left fer a
drap apiece if we pass it around."</p>

<p>"Drink up your stuff," said Red Sam. "It's poor
firewater, anyhow. I'm fer the poker. Does you
come inter this yere game, young gent, same as ye did
oncet before?"</p>

<p>This question was addressed to Frank, but Merry
already "smelled a mouse," and so it did not need the
warning look from Gonchita and the slight shake of
her head to deter him.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he said. "I have no money."</p>

<p>"Waal, fish some out o' the linin' o' your clothes,
same as you did afore," advised Sam.</p>

<p>"But I have none in the lining of my clothes."</p>

<p>"I begs yer pardon, but we knows a heap sight better.
Don't try no monkey business with us, younker!
You was good enough ter git inter a game oncet before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
an' try ter show us up, so we gives ye another
chanct, an' ye'd better accept it in a hurry."</p>

<p>"I hardly think I have a friend here who will be
willing to lend me money," smiled Merry. "Unless
somebody does so, I cannot play. That being the
case, I reckon I'll keep out of it."</p>

<p>Sam laid a hand on the butt of his revolver.</p>

<p>"You can't play none of that with us!" he declared
fiercely. "We knows how you found the money afore,
an' you'll find it ag'in. Come, be lively."</p>

<p>Frank looked the man over.</p>

<p>"You could get blood from a turnip easier than
money from me," he declared.</p>

<p>Then, as Red Sam seemed about to draw his weapon,
Gonchita chipped in, crying:</p>

<p>"Don't do it, Sam! I have you cover' weez my
peestol! I weel shoot!"</p>

<p>The men were astonished, for Gonchita had drawn
a pistol and had it pointed at the head of Red Sam,
while in her dark eyes there was a deadly gleam.</p>

<p>"What in blazes is the matter with you?" snarled
Red Sam, looking at her over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"You hear what Gonchita say," she purred, a flush
in her brown cheeks. "She mena de busineeze."</p>

<p>Frank could not help admiring her then, for she
presented a very pretty picture.</p>

<p>Reluctantly Sam thrust back his weapon into his
holster.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right!" he laughed coarsely. "I see you're
stuck up a heap on the feller."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"You not to shoot heem while I am around."</p>

<p>"Whoop!" roared Brazos Tom, in apparent delight.
"Thar's a gal fer ye! I shore admires her style!"</p>

<p>Then, being in a position to do so, he sprang on
Gonchita, caught her in his strong arms so she could
not defend herself, and gave her a bearlike hug and a
kiss.</p>

<p>The next instant something like a hard piece of iron
struck Tom behind the ear and he measured his length
on the ground. Frank Merriwell had reached his feet
at a bound, and hit the giant a blow that knocked him
down in a twinkling.</p>

<p>Through all this Gonchita had held fast to her
drawn revolver, and now she had it ready for use, so
that, when those ruffians placed hands on their weapons,
she again warned them.</p>

<p>At the same time she flung herself between them
and Frank, so that he was partly protected as he stood
over Brazos Tom, who lay prone and dazed.</p>

<p>"Take hees peestols!" she palpitated.</p>

<p>And Frank followed this piece of advice, relieving
the fallen ruffian of his revolvers, so that Tom's hand
reached vainly for one of the weapons as he began
to recover.</p>

<p>"Eef you make de fight," said the girl to the ruffians,
"we now gif you eet all you want."</p>

<p>Never before had they seen her in such a mood,
and they were astounded. But they knew she could
shoot, for they had seen her display her marksmanship.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"You little fool!" grated Sam. "Are you goin' to
help that galoot try to git erway?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not dat; but I see he ees not hurt till
Beel he come back."</p>

<p>Then she commanded Frank to throw down the
pistol he had taken from Tom, which Merry did, knowing
there was no chance for him to escape then without
a shooting affray, in which he was almost certain to
be wounded.</p>

<p>Immediately on this act of Frank's the ruffians
seemed to abandon any desire to draw and shoot at
him.</p>

<p>But Brazos Tom rose in a great rage, almost frothing
at the mouth.</p>

<p>"Ten thousan' tarantulas!" he howled. "Let me git
my paws on him!"</p>

<p>He made a rush for Frank, who seemed to stand
still to meet him, but stepped aside just as the ruffian
tried to fold him in his arms.</p>

<p>Then the big wretch was somehow caught about the
body, lifted into the air, and sent crashing to the
ground, striking on his head and shoulders. The
young athlete from Yale handled Brazos Tom with
such ease that every witness was astounded.</p>

<p>The big fellow lay where he fell, stunned and finished.</p>

<p>Gonchita looked at Frank with a light of the most
intense admiration in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"How you do eet so easee?" she asked.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's nothing, with a bungler like him to meet,"
said Merry quietly.</p>

<p>The ruffians said nothing, but exchanged meaning
glances. They had been foiled for the time being by
the girl and by the cleverness of their captive.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<h3>LOST IN THE MOUNTAINS.</h3>


<p>Four persons were lost in the mountains. Three of
them were young men who were scarcely more than
youths. All were mounted on broncos.</p>

<p>One was a bright-eyed, apple-cheeked chap, who had
an odd manner of talking, and who emphasized his
words with little gestures and flirts of his hand that
were very peculiar. Another was dark and silent, with
a face that was decidedly handsome, although it denoted
a person given more or less to brooding and
morbid thoughts. The third youth was long and lank
and talked with a nasal drawl and a manner of speech
that proclaimed him a down-easter.</p>

<p>These three were respectively Jack Ready, Bart
Hodge, and Ephraim Gallup, all friends and former
companions of Frank Merriwell.</p>

<p>The fourth one of the party was a red-nosed bummer,
known as Whisky Jim, whom they had picked up
to guide them from the little railroad-town to Frank
Merriwell's mine. Jim had averred that he knew
"every squar' foot o' Arizony frum the Grand Cañon
to the Mexican line," and they had trusted in his promise
to lead them, with the smallest possible delay, to
the Queen Mystery Mine.</p>

<p>Jim would not acknowledge that he was lost.  They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
had provided him with the bronco he bestrode and
promised him good pay when they should come to the
mine. He had collected enough in advance to "outfit"
with a liberal supply of whisky, and had managed to
keep beautifully loaded ever since they rode out to the
Southwest.</p>

<p>Their horses were wearied and reluctant, while they
were sun-scorched and covered with dust.</p>

<p>"By gum!" groaned Gallup. "I'm purty near
pegged! This is too much fer me. I wish I was to
hum on the farm!"</p>

<p>"Prithee say not so!" cried Ready. "You give unto
me that feeling of sadness known to those who are
homesick. Ah, me! to endure thus to have my beautiful
complexion destroyed by this horrid sun! And
behold my lily-white hands! Are they not spectacles
to make the gods sigh with regret! Permit me to
squeeze out a few salt teardrops."</p>

<p>Hodge was saying nothing.</p>

<p>"'Sall ri', boysh," assured the useless guide thickly.
"Jesht you wait an' shee. Whazzer mazzer with you?
I know m' bushiness. Who shays I dunno m' bushiness?"</p>

<p>He was able to sit perfectly straight in the saddle,
although he was disgustingly intoxicated.</p>

<p>"I say you don't know your business, you old fool!"
said Hodge, breaking out at last. "It would serve you
right if we were to leave you here in the mountains.
A great guide you are! You'd die if we left you!
You'd never find your way out."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim looked astonished. This was the first time
Bart had broken forth thus plainly.</p>

<p>"You don't mean it?" he gurgled.</p>

<p>"You bet your life I meant it! I'm in for leaving
you to get back to town the best way you can."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't do that!" exclaimed Jim, sobered somewhat
by his alarm. "Someshin' might happen t' you,
boysh."</p>

<p>"Let's leave him," nodded Jack Ready, amused by
the consternation of the old fellow.</p>

<p>"Derned ef we don't!" cried Gallup.</p>

<p>Upon which the "guide" became greatly alarmed,
begging them for the love of goodness not to leave
him there in the mountains to die alone.</p>

<p>"But you're a guide," said Hodge. "You would be
able to get out all right."</p>

<p>"Boysh," said the old toper, "I got a 'fession to
make."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I ain't been in the guidin' bushiness for shome
time. I'm a leetle rusty; jest a bit out o' practish.
That's whazzer mazzer."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so in the first place? What
made you lie to us?"</p>

<p>"Boysh, I needed the moneysh. Hones' Injun, I
needed the moneysh bad. Been a long time shince I've
had all the whisky I could hold. Great treat f' me."</p>

<p>Bart was disgusted, but Jack Ready was inclined
to look at the affair in a humorous light.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know the meaning of those smoke clouds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
we saw," said Hodge. "They looked mighty queer
to me."</p>

<p>They consulted together, finally deciding to halt in
a shadowy valley and wait for the declining of the
sun, which would bring cooler air.</p>

<p>They confessed to one another that they were lost,
and all felt that the situation was serious. It was not
at all strange that Hodge was very angry with the
worthless old toper who had led them into this predicament.</p>

<p>"We may never get out of these mountains," he said.
"Or, if we do, we may perish in the desert. I tell you,
fellows, we're in a bad scrape!"</p>

<p>"Dear me!" sighed Ready. "And I anticipated great
pleasure in surprising Merry to-day. Alas and alack!
such is life. I know this dreadful sunshine will spoil
my complexion!"</p>

<p>Gallup looked dolefully at the horses, which were
feeding on the buffalo-grass of the valley.</p>

<p>"We're a pack of darn fools!" he observed. "We'd
oughter sent word to Frankie that we was comin', an'
then he'd bin on hand to meet us."</p>

<p>The "guide" had stretched himself in the shadow
of some boulders and fallen fast asleep.</p>

<p>"I suppose I'm to blame for this thing, fellows,"
said Bart grimly. "It was my scheme to take Merry
by surprise."</p>

<p>"Waal, I ruther guess all the rest of us was reddy
enough ter agree to it," put in Gallup. "We're jest ez
much to blame as you be."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>They talked the situation over for a while. Finally
Bart rose and strolled off by himself, Gallup calling
after him to look out and not go so far that he could
not find his way back.</p>

<p>Hodge was gone almost an hour. His friends were
growing alarmed, when he came racing back to them,
his face flushed with excitement and his eyes flashing.</p>

<p>"Come, fellows!" he cried, his voice thrilling them.
"I've got something to show you! We're wanted
mighty bad by a friend of ours who is in trouble!"</p>

<p>They were on their feet.</p>

<p>"Who in thutteration be you talkin' abaout?" asked
Gallup.</p>

<p>"Perchance you mean Frank?" said Ready.</p>

<p>"You bet your life!" said Bart. "Make sure your
rifles are in working order! Leave the horses right
where they're picketed. Leave Jim with them. He'll
look after them, if he awakes."</p>

<p>For Whisky Jim continued to sleep soundly through
all this.</p>

<p>So they seized their weapons and prepared to follow
Bart.</p>

<p>As they ran, Bart made a brief explanation. He had
climbed to a point from whence he looked down into
a grassy valley, and there he discovered some horses
and men. The horses were feeding, and the men were
reclining in the shade, with the exception of one or
two. While Bart looked he recognized one of the
men, and also saw a girl. At first he thought he must
be deceived, but soon he was satisfied that the one he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
recognized was the comrade he had traveled thousands
of miles to join, bringing with him Ready and
Gallup.</p>

<p>As he watched, he saw the encounter between Merry
and Brazos Tom, and that was enough to satisfy
Hodge that his friend was in serious trouble. Then
he hastened back to get Jack and Ephraim.</p>

<p>When Bart again reached the point where he could
look into that valley he was astonished to discover
that another struggle was taking place down there.</p>

<p>Frank was engaged in a knife-duel with Red Sam,
having been forced into it. And Red Sam meant to
kill him.</p>

<p>The watching ruffians were gathered around, while
Gonchita, a pistol in her hand, was watching to see
that the youth had fair play.</p>

<p>Without doubt, the sandy ruffian had expected to
find Merriwell easy, and finish him quickly in an engagement
of this sort. But Frank Merriwell had
been instructed in knife-play by a clever expert, and
he soon amazed Red Sam and the other ruffians by
meeting the fellow's assault, catching his blade, parrying
thrust after thrust, leaping, dodging, turning,
charging, retreating, and making such a wonderful
contest of it that the spectators were electrified.</p>

<p>It was Frank's knife that drew first blood. He slit
the ruffian's sleeve at the shoulder and cut the man
slightly.</p>

<p>Gonchita's dark eyes gleamed. More than ever she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
marveled at this wonderful youth, who seemed more
than a match for any single ruffian of Bill's band.</p>

<p>"He is a wonder!" she told herself. "Oh, he is
grand! They meant to kill him. If he beats Red Sam
they shall not kill him."</p>

<p>Sam swore when he felt the knife clip his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I'll have your heart's blood!" he snarled.</p>

<p>Frank smiled into his face in a manner that enraptured
the watching girl.</p>

<p>"You are welcome to it&mdash;if you can get it! But look
out for yourself!"</p>

<p>Then he began a whirlwindlike assault upon Sam,
whom he soon bewildered by his movements. He
played about the man like a leaping panther. Once
Sam struck hard at Frank's breast, and Merry leaped
away barely in time, for the keen knife slit the front
of his shirt, exposing the clean white skin beneath.</p>

<p>But again and again Frank cut the big ruffian
slightly, so that soon Sam was bleeding from almost a
dozen wounds and slowly growing weaker in spite of
his efforts to brace up.</p>

<p>The knives sometimes flashed together. The men
stood and stared into each other's eyes. Then they
leaped and dodged and struck and struck again.</p>

<p>Little did Frank dream of the friends who were
watching him from above.</p>

<p>Bart Hodge was thrilled into silence by the spectacle.
He knelt, with his rifle ready for instant use, panting
as the battle for life continued.</p>

<p>"Great gosh all hemlock!" gurgled Ephraim Gallup,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
his eyes bulging. "Did you ever see anything
like that in all your natteral born days? Dern my
squash ef I ever did!"</p>

<p>"It is beautiful!" said Jack Ready. "Frank is doing
almost as well as I could do myself! I'll have to
compliment him on his clever work."</p>

<p>Twice Bart Hodge had the butt of his rifle against
his shoulder, but lowered it without firing.</p>

<p>"He's gittin' the best of the red-headed feller!"
panted Gallup.</p>

<p>"Of course!" nodded Ready. "Did you look for
anything else to happen?"</p>

<p>"Them men don't like it much of enny."</p>

<p>"They do not seem greatly pleased."</p>

<p>"I bet they all go fer him if he does the red-head
up."</p>

<p>"In which case," chirped Jack, "it will be our duty
to insert a few lead pills into them."</p>

<p>Bart was not talking. He believed Frank in constant
danger of a most deadly sort, and he was watching
every move of the ruffians, ready to balk any attempt
at treachery.</p>

<p>As Sam weakened Frank pressed him harder. The
fellow believed Merry meant to kill him, if possible.</p>

<p>At length Merriwell caught Sam's blade with his
own, gave it a sudden twist, and the fellow's knife
was sent spinning through the air, to fall to the ground
at a distance.</p>

<p>At that moment one of the ruffians suddenly flung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
up a hand that held a revolver, meaning to shoot Frank
through the head.</p>

<p>Before he could fire, however, he pitched forward on
his face.</p>

<p>Down from the heights above came the clear report
of the rifle in the hands of Bartley Hodge.</p>

<p>Bart had saved the life of his old friend.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<h3>FRANK'S ESCAPE.</h3>


<p>As the ruffian pitched forward on his face, Gonchita
uttered a cry. The attention of the men was turned
toward the point from which the unexpected shot had
come. The Mexican girl caught hold of Merry, thrust
a pistol into his hand, and hissed:</p>

<p>"Back&mdash;back there! Quick! It's your chance!
You take eet!"</p>

<p>Frank did not hesitate. With the pistol in his hand,
he went leaping toward the point of cover indicated.
He was behind the rocks before the desperadoes realized
what had taken place. They turned, uttering
exclamations of anger and dismay.</p>

<p>"Steady, you chaps!" rang out Frank's clear voice.
"Keep your distance! If you don't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But now the three young fellows above began shooting
into the valley, and their whistling bullets sent the
ruffians scudding to cover.</p>

<p>Gonchita disdained to fly. She walked deliberately
to the shelter of the rocks near Frank.</p>

<p>"I geet horse for you," she said. "You take eet an'
ride. Eet ees your chance. Mebbe them your friend?"</p>

<p>Frank had caught barely a glimpse of the three fellows,
and he was not at all sure that his eyes had not
deceived him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps they are my friends," he said. "They
must be."</p>

<p>"You ready to go?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She ran out and pulled the picket pin of one of the
horses. This animal she brought up close to the point
where Frank crouched.</p>

<p>"Take heem queek!" she panted. "You haf de
chance! Down de vallee. Mebbe you git 'way."</p>

<p>Frank hesitated. He knew the danger of such an
attempt. He no longer doubted the friendliness of
Gonchita, although the remarkable change in her was
most astonishing.</p>

<p>But the firing from above continued, and the ruffians
were forced to again take to their heels and seek still
safer shelter farther up the valley.</p>

<p>That was Merry's opportunity, and he seized it. In
a twinkling, while the rascals were in confusion, he
leaped upon the bare back of the horse, headed the animal
down the valley, and was off.</p>

<p>A yell came down from above; but Frank, bending
low, did not answer it.</p>

<p>Two or three bullets were sent after him. He was
untouched, however.</p>

<p>Gonchita had armed him with two pistols, neither
of which he had used. One he held gripped in his
hand as the horse carried him tearing down the valley,
and thus he came full upon Cimarron Bill, who
was returning to his satellites.</p>

<p>Bill was astounded. He had drawn a pistol, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
he fired at the rider who was stooping low along the
neck of the horse. The animal tossed its head and
took the bullet in his brain.</p>

<p>Even as the horse fell, Frank fired in return. He
flung himself from the animal, striking on his feet.</p>

<p>Bill's horse reared high in the air, striking with
its forward feet. The rider leaned forward and fired
from beneath the creature's neck as it stood on its
hind legs, but the movements of the animal prevented
him from accuracy.</p>

<p>Merry's second shot struck the hind leg of Bill's
horse, and the creature came down in such a manner
that its rider was pitched off, striking upon his head
and shoulders.</p>

<p>Frank did not fire again, for Bill lay in a heap on
the ground. The horse struggled up, being caught by
Merry. Frank looked to the beast's wound, fearing
to find its leg broken. This, however, was not the
case, although the bullet had made a rather ugly little
wound.</p>

<p>In another moment Frank was in Bill's saddle, and
away he went on the back of the chief's horse, leaving
the stunned rascal where he had fallen.</p>

<p>"An exchange of horses," he half-laughed. "You
may have my dead one in place of your wounded one.
If you do not like the bargain, Captain Bill, blame
yourself."</p>

<p>He was in no great fear of pursuit, but he longed
to know just what friends had come to his rescue at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
such an opportune moment. How was he to reach
them?</p>

<p>When he felt that he was safe, he drew up Bill's
splendid horse, dismounted and examined the bleeding
wound. It was far less serious than he had feared,
and he proceeded to dress it, tearing his handkerchief
into strips to tie about the creature's leg.</p>

<p>Having attended to his horse, Merry remounted and
sought to find a means of approaching the spot from
which his unknown friends had fired into the valley
at such an opportune moment.</p>

<p>He was thus employed when he came upon a most
disreputable-looking old bummer, who had in his possession
four horses. This man was startled by the
appearance of Merriwell and acted very strangely.</p>

<p>Frank rode slowly forward, ready for whatever
might take place. However, he was recognized by
the man, who uttered a shout of astonishment.</p>

<p>The man with the horses was Whisky Jim, who had
awakened to find his companions gone.</p>

<p>He greeted Merriwell with protestations of delight.</p>

<p>"I knew I wash a guide!" he said. "Who shed I
washn't guide? I shed I'd bring 'em to Frank Merriwell,
an' I done it. But whazzer mazzer? Where zey
gone? I dunno."</p>

<p>Barely had Merry started to question the old toper
when Hodge, Ready, and Gallup appeared, hurrying
forward. When they saw Merriwell they gave a cheer
of delight, and, one minute later, they were shaking
hands with him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"What does this mean?" asked Frank, when he
could recover enough to ask anything.</p>

<p>"It means," said Bart, "that we are here to back
you up in your fight against the mining trust. You
can depend on us to stand by you. After getting
your letter, in which you wrote all about the hot time
you were having fighting the trust, I hastened to get
hold of Ready and Gallup and light out for this part
of our great and glorious country. Here we are,
though we're dead in luck to find you, for this drunken
duffer managed to lose us here in the mountains."</p>

<p>"And you were the ones who chipped in just at the
right time after my little encounter with Red Sam?
Fellows, you have given me the surprise of my life!
It's great to see you again! I ran into those gents, or
was led into a trap by a very singular girl, and it
looked as if I was in a bad box. The girl, however,
seemed to change her mind after getting me into the
scrape, and she wanted to get me out. I owe her a
lot. But there is no telling when Cimarron Bill and
his gang may come hiking this way after me, so I
propose that we light out for the Queen Mystery,
where we can talk things over at our leisure."</p>

<p>They were ready enough to follow his lead.</p>

<p>Jim Tracy sat with his feet elevated upon Frank
Merriwell's table, smoking his pipe and talking to Hop
Anson, who was on the opposite side of the table when
the door opened and Frank stepped in, followed by
his friends, with Whisky Jim staggering along in the
rear.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Tracy's boots came down from the table with a
thud, and he jumped up, uttering an exclamation and
looking astounded.</p>

<p>"Well, may I be derned!" he said, staring at Frank.</p>

<p>Now Merriwell was not at all pleased to find the
foreman making free in his cabin in such a manner.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Tracy?" he asked sharply, glancing
from Jim's face to that of Anson, who seemed
no less confounded. "You seem disturbed."</p>

<p>"I allow I didn't expect ye back so soon," mumbled
the foreman, who could not recover his composure at
once.</p>

<p>"But I told you I might be back in a few hours, or
I might not return for many days."</p>

<p>"I know, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing!"</p>

<p>"It's plain you were making yourself quite at home
here. What were you doing with Anson?"</p>

<p>"Jest givin' him a piece o' my mind," answered
Tracy promptly. "I reckon he knows now purty well
what I think of him."</p>

<p>Now to Merry, it had seemed on his appearance that
these two men were engaged in a confidential chat.</p>

<p>"Well, couldn't you find some other place to talk to
him?" Frank asked.</p>

<p>"I brought him here so the rest of the boys wouldn't
hear us," explained Tracy. "I opined they might take
a right strong dislike to him in case they found out
what happened this mornin'."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have not told them?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, your consideration for Anson seems very
strange, considering the talk you made to-day at an
earlier hour."</p>

<p>"I'm jest follerin' your orders," protested the foreman,
not at all pleased by Merry's manner.</p>

<p>"Very well. You may retire, Tracy. Boys, make
yourselves at home."</p>

<p>As Tracy and Anson were going out, the eyes of the
latter encountered those of Whisky Jim, who was
surveying him closely in a drunken manner.</p>

<p>"Who are you lookin' at?" muttered Anson.</p>

<p>"Sheems to me," said Jim thickly, "I'm a-lookin' at
a gent what had shome deeficulty down Tucson way
'bout takin' a hoss what b'longed to nozzer man."</p>

<p>"You're a liar, you drunken dog!" grated Anson, as
he hastened from the cabin.</p>

<p>"Do you know that man?" asked Merry, of Jim.</p>

<p>"Sh!" hissed the toper, with a cautioning gesture.
"I don't want 't gener'lly know I ever shaw him before.
He'sh a hosh-thief. He'd shteal anything, he
would. I never 'nowledge him ash 'quaintance of
mine."</p>

<p>"Do you know the other man, my foreman?"</p>

<p>"Sheems to look ruzer nacheral," said Jim; "but
can't 'zactly plashe him. All shame, if he keeps
comp'ny wish that hosh-thief, you look out f' him."</p>

<p>Frank celebrated his safe return to the mine in
company with his friends by preparing a rather elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
spread, and all gathered about the table to enjoy
it and chat about old times and the present fight Merry
was making against the mining trust.</p>

<p>"Waal, dinged if this ain't scrumpshus!" cried Ephraim
Gallup. "I'm feelin' a hanged sight better than
I was when we was lost out in the maountains this
arternoon."</p>

<p>"Fellows," said Merry, "you have given me the surprise
of my life. I never dreamed of seeing you at
such a time. And Bart's shot saved my life. I know
it! I owe him everything!"</p>

<p>There was a glow of satisfaction in the dark eyes
of Hodge.</p>

<p>"You owe me nothing," he said earnestly. "Whatever
I am I owe it to you. Do you think I am a
fellow to forget? That is why I am here. I felt that
this was the time for me to prove my loyalty. When
I explained it to Ephraim and Jack they were eager
to come with me to back you in your fight. If you
need them, you can have any of the old gang. They'll
come to a man."</p>

<p>"Thus far," said Merry, "I have been able to balk
every move of the enemy. They have employed ruffians
who hesitate at nothing. You saw the fellow
with the bandaged hand who was here with my foreman?
Well, it was this very morning, while I was
shaving at that glass, that he crept up to that open
door and tried to shoot me in the back. I fired first,
and he has lost a few fingers."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Ready. "I'm so frightened!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
What if somebody should take a fancy to shoot me
full of holes! It might damage me beyond repair!"</p>

<p>"Gol ding it!" chuckled Gallup. "You must be
havin' enough to keep you alfired busy around here.
But what is that chap a-doin' of stayin' here?"</p>

<p>Frank explained fully about Hop Anson, adding that
he had partly believed Anson's statement that it was
the foreman for whom he was looking.</p>

<p>"But since coming back here unexpectedly," said
Merry, "and finding them together in such a friendly
fashion, I am inclined to think differently. Tracy pretended
to have a powerful feeling against Anson.
Something leads me to believe now that Tracy will
bear watching."</p>

<p>They sat up until a late hour talking over old times
and other matters that interested them all. When they
slept they took pains to make sure that the door and
windows were secured.</p>

<p>Whisky Jim slept outside in another building.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<h3>MYSTERIOUS PABLO.</h3>


<p>The following morning, while Frank and his friends
were at breakfast, there came the sounds of a struggle
outside the cabin, followed by a knock on the door.</p>

<p>Merry drew a revolver and laid it in his lap.</p>

<p>"Come in," he called.</p>

<p>The door was flung open, and Tracy entered, dragging
by the collar a small Mexican lad, who held back
and betrayed every evidence of terror.</p>

<p>"Found him skulking about, Mr. Merriwell," said
the foreman. "Don't know whar he come from. Just
brought him yere fer you to deal with."</p>

<p>The boy seemed badly frightened.</p>

<p>"Let him go, Tracy," said Frank.</p>

<p>The boy hesitated when released, seeming on the
point of running, but pausing to look appealingly at
Merry. He was not a bad-looking little chap, although
he was rather dirty and unkempt. He had
wondrous dark eyes, big and full of interrogation.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, what do you want?" asked Merry,
in a kindly way.</p>

<p>The boy shook his head.</p>

<p>"I want notheenk de señor can gif," he answered, in
a low tone.</p>

<p>"How came you around here?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hunt for my seestar."</p>

<p>"Your sister?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>."</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"That I cannot tell, señor. She be take away by
de bad man. He haf fool her, I t'ink."</p>

<p>"What bad man do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Seester call heem Beel."</p>

<p>"Bill?"</p>

<p>"Dat ees hees name."</p>

<p>"Bill what?"</p>

<p>The boy shook his head once more.</p>

<p>"I know eet not," he said. "He half manee man
like heem who do what he say. He get my seester to
go wif heem."</p>

<p>"What is your sister's name?"</p>

<p>"Eet ees Gonchita."</p>

<p>Frank jumped.</p>

<p>"Gonchita?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Dat ees eet," nodded the boy. "Mebbe you do
know her?"</p>

<p>"I think I have seen her," said Merry. "By Jove!
So this fellow Bill led her to run away with him, did
he, the scoundrel? And you are searching for him.
What will you do if you find him?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell, but I want my seestar to come 'way
an' leaf heem. He ees bad man."</p>

<p>"That's right. What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Pablo."</p>

<p>"Well, Pablo, my boy, I hope you find your sister all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
right and get her away from Bill, but you have a big
job on your hands. Come here and have some breakfast.
Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, vera hungree, señor!"</p>

<p>"You shall have all you can eat. It's all right,
Tracy. You may go. I'll take care of the kid."</p>

<p>"I wish to report, sir," said Tracy, "that Hop Anson
is missing."</p>

<p>"What's that? Anson&mdash;he's gone?"</p>

<p>"Skipped out last night, sir. He was not to be
found this morning. I thought he'd do it, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, let him go. I don't think he'll do much
harm."</p>

<p>"If you had listened to me, I'd fixed him so he'd
never done any further harm."</p>

<p>"All right, Tracy&mdash;all right. I'll see you later."</p>

<p>Tracy left the room.</p>

<p>"Look out for that man, Frank," said Hodge, in an
ominous manner. "He is not to be trusted at all."</p>

<p>"All right," said Merry. "We'll not discuss him&mdash;now."
Which remark was made with a meaning
look toward the Mexican lad.</p>

<p>Pablo was given a place at the table and a steaming
cup of coffee placed before him. Corn bread and
bacon, with some canned stuff, made up the breakfast,
and the boy ate almost ravenously of everything given
him. But he kept his hat pulled low over his eyes
all the while.</p>

<p>After breakfast Frank sought to question Pablo
further, succeeding in drawing from the boy that both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
his father and mother were dead, and that he had lived
in Holbrook with his sister, where she had seen Bill,
who seemed to fascinate her. At least she had run
away with the man, and, arming himself with a
knife and pistol, Pablo had followed to rescue or
avenge her. Chance had led him to the valley in
which the Queen Mystery Mine was located.</p>

<p>It was rather a pathetic little story, and Merry was
somewhat stirred by it.</p>

<p>"What could you do if you should find Bill?" he
asked.</p>

<p>A grim look came to Pablo's soiled yet attractive
face.</p>

<p>"I haf my peestol," he said.</p>

<p>"But Bill is a very bad man, and he would have a
pistol, too."</p>

<p>"I do my best. I am not skeert of Beel."</p>

<p>"Well, as I happen to know something of Bill, I
tell you now, Pablo, that it will be better for you if
you never meet him."</p>

<p>"But my seestar&mdash;my seestar! I mus' find her."</p>

<p>Frank was tempted to tell the boy what he knew
about Gonchita, but decided not to do so, believing
it would be to no purpose.</p>

<p>So Pablo remained in the valley for the time, seeming
in no hurry to continue the search for his sister.
He wandered about the mine and the buildings, peering
curiously at everything with his big eyes, listening
to the talk of the men, and seeming to have a great
curiosity.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>All this was observed by Bart Hodge, who watched
the lad as closely as possible. That afternoon Bart
said to Frank:</p>

<p>"Merry, that greaser boy acts queer. Have you
noticed it?"</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, he told a story about being in a dreadful
hurry to find his sister, but he hangs around here."</p>

<p>"I suppose the little chap doesn't know where to
look for the girl."</p>

<p>"But he's such an inquisitive little rascal. He goes
slipping around everywhere, looking at everything, and
listening to the talk of the men. He acts to me like
a spy."</p>

<p>"It's his way. Mexicans have a sneaking way about
them, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, it may be his way, but I wouldn't trust
him."</p>

<p>"I don't propose to trust him," said Frank, with a
laugh. "I am not given to trusting greasers. It is
probable that he will go away to-morrow and we'll
never see anything more of him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so."</p>

<p>"I expect to find him gone in the morning," said
Merry.</p>

<p>But in the morning Pablo was found sleeping just
outside Frank's door when Merry opened it. He lay
there, his old hat pulled down over his ears, curled
up like a dog; but he started wide-awake and sat up,
staring at Merriwell with his big black eyes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"What the dickens you doing here?" asked Frank,
annoyed.</p>

<p>"I tak' de sleep," grinned Pablo faintly.</p>

<p>"Well, couldn't you find any other place? Have
you been there all night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I haf no odar place. Thees good for Pablo."</p>

<p>"Well, it may be all right for you; but it seems
deuced uncomfortable to me. When are you going to
look for Bill and your sister?"</p>

<p>"<i>Manana</i>."</p>

<p>"To-morrow?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>."</p>

<p>Frank could not refrain from smiling at this characteristic
answer. With the Spaniards everything is
to be done to-morrow, and the lazy Mexican, having
adopted the language of the Spaniard, has also adopted
his motto.</p>

<p>When Frank turned back he found Hodge washing.</p>

<p>"I told you," said Bart. "The fellow acts to me
like a spy. It wouldn't surprise me to find out that
he had been sent here by Bill. This story about his
sister may be faked up."</p>

<p>"But I know Gonchita is with the ruffians."</p>

<p>"That's all right. That makes it all the easier to
deceive you. That made the boy's story seem all the
more probable. Just you watch him close and see if
he doesn't act the spy."</p>

<p>"All right," laughed Merry. "But let's have breakfast
without worrying about him."</p>

<p>It was necessary to drag Ready out.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, me! oh, my!" sighed Jack dolefully. "Methinks
I have bestridden something that hath galled
me extensively. I am likewise weary and sore in every
limb and joint."</p>

<p>Gallup had stood the riding much better, but even he
was lame.</p>

<p>After breakfast Frank went out and found Pablo
curled in the sunshine around the corner of the hut.
And not more than four feet from the Mexican lad
was a rattlesnake.</p>

<p>The crack of the pistol in Frank's hand caused
Pablo to start up with a jump. He stared in astonishment
at Merry, who stood over him, holding the
smoking pistol. Then he looked and saw the headless
snake stretched on the ground.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Madre de Dios</i>!" he cried. "You shoot de
snake! Mebbe you save me from de snake!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," nodded Frank, with a slight smile.
"You had better be careful, for snakes are not all the
dangerous things you will find on the ground."</p>

<p>Pablo made a spring and caught Frank's hand.</p>

<p>"To me you are so veree goode!" he said, kissing
Merry's hand in a manner that surprised Frank somewhat.</p>

<p>Then he saw the pistol with which the snake had
been shot.</p>

<p>"<i>Carrambo</i>!" he cried, in astonishment. "Where
you geet eet? De peestol. Eet do belong to my seestar."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>For Merry had shot the snake with the pistol given
him by Gonchita.</p>

<p>"How you haf eet?" asked Pablo, with great eagerness.
"Where you geet eet?"</p>

<p>Frank was fairly cornered. As a result, he sat down
there and told the Mexican boy of his capture by
Cimarron Bill's gang and of Gonchita.</p>

<p>"Then she be steel alife?" exclaimed Pablo. "Beel
haf not keeled her!"</p>

<p>"He had not then."</p>

<p>"But she help you to geet away?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then mebbe Beel be veree angry weeth her&mdash;mebbe
he keel her! Eef he do that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If he does he ought to be hanged! Pablo, Bill is
sure to be hanged or shot before long, anyhow."</p>

<p>"But he tell Gonchita he mak' veree much monee.
He say big men what can buy the law pay him much
monee."</p>

<p>"I know what he means, Pablo. A lot of men have
banded together to rob me of my mines, this one here
and another in Mexico. They expected to do so with
ease at first, but made a fizzle of it. They thought
to take the mines from me by law; but now they know
they cannot do that, and they have hired Bill and his
ruffians to seize it. Those men are the ones who are
paying Bill for his work. He expects they will protect
him when it is done. He is looking for a pardon
for all past offenses."</p>

<p>"But you weel not let him beat you?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not if I can help it. He has failed thus far. He
attacked the mine with his ruffians and was repulsed."</p>

<p>"De nex' time he do eet deeferent. He come een
when you do not expect. Mebbe he geet somebody to
gef de mine up to them."</p>

<p>"Nobody here," said Merry, with a laugh. "I can
trust my men."</p>

<p>"You theenk so."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure of it."</p>

<p>"One try to shoot you not long 'go."</p>

<p>"Yes. How did you learn of that?"</p>

<p>"Pablo have de ear. He hear something."</p>

<p>"What did you hear?"</p>

<p>"Dat man be paid to try de shoot."</p>

<p>"Look here, how do you know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I hear some of de men talk. They all say
they pritee sure of eet. How you like my seestar?"</p>

<p>The boy asked the question with such suddenness
that Frank was a bit startled.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for her, Pablo. I'm sorry Bill has her
in his hands."</p>

<p>"Oh, Beel he say he marree her; but I know he lie.
Mebbe she know eet now. Beel want her to help heem.
You theenk she veree bad girl?"</p>

<p>This question was put almost pathetically, Pablo
again grasping Frank's hand and gazing wistfully into
Merry's eyes.</p>

<p>"No; I do not think she is very bad."</p>

<p>"She do noteeng to make you theenk so?"</p>

<p>"Well, she fooled me somewhat at first by telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
me a story about her wounded father. She had such
an innocent way that I swallowed the yarn. That was
how I fell into Bill's hands. I accompanied her to go,
as I supposed, to her wounded father. She decoyed
me into a trap."</p>

<p>"But afterward&mdash;afterward?" eagerly asked the boy.</p>

<p>"She seemed to change in a most remarkable manner,
and helped me out of it. But for her, I fancy
I'd surely been disposed of by those ruffians."</p>

<p>"Then you see she be not so veree bad. When she
first see you mebbe she never seen you before. Mebbe
she haf promeesed to Beel that she take you eento trap.
Aftare she see you she be soree, and she want you to
geet away."</p>

<p>"I think that was about the way things happened,
Pablo."</p>

<p>"I am glad you do not theenk she ees so veree bad
girl. What you do eef I breeng her here?"</p>

<p>"What would I do?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si señor</i>; how you like eet?"</p>

<p>Pablo was watching Frank's face closely.</p>

<p>"Why, I would do my best for her," said Merry.

<p>"You would not be veree angree?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor veree please'?"</p>

<p>"Why, for your sake I would be pleased."</p>

<p>"But you never care for your own sake at all?
You never want to see my seestar again?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"And to do her any other favor in my power. I
am not ungrateful enough to forget what she did for
me."</p>

<p>"Dat ees all?"</p>

<p>"What more do you want?" demanded Merry, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Notheeng," murmured Pablo regretfully, as he
turned and walked away.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<h3>MERRY'S DISCOVERY.</h3>


<p>The actions of Tracy seemed strangely suspicious to
Merry, who undertook to watch the man, only to find
that Pablo seemed to be watching him still more
closely. Thus it happened that Merry followed the
foreman up the valley and saw him meet another man
at a point removed beyond view of the mine.</p>

<p>The man Tracy met was none other than Hop Anson,
readily recognized at a distance by his bandaged
hand.</p>

<p>"Something doing!" muttered Frank, as he crouched
behind the rocks and watched the two. "Tracy wanted
to lynch Anson. Now they meet like this, apparently
by appointment. My foreman is playing some sort
of a double game."</p>

<p>This point was settled in Frank's mind. He longed
to be near enough to hear what was passing between
the two, but could not reach such a position without
exposing himself.</p>

<p>The men were suspicious that they might be
watched. They did not remain there long. But Frank
distinctly saw Anson give Tracy something, which the
latter placed in his pocket. Then the foreman turned
back, and Hop Anson vanished in the opposite direction.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank was tempted to step out and confront the
foreman, demanding to know what it meant, but he
chose to remain quiet and seek the truth in another
manner. So he let Tracy pass.</p>

<p>But when the foreman had disappeared Merry
sprang up and went racing after Hop Anson, hoping
to run the rascal down. He came out where he could
see far along a broad gorge, and there, riding into the
distance, mounted on a good horse, was Anson. Frank
knew the folly of trying further pursuit, so he stood
still and watched the vanishing figure.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know just what it was that Hop Anson
gave Tracy," he said, aloud.</p>

<p>Immediately, within less than twenty feet from him,
Pablo, the Mexican boy, arose into view.</p>

<p>"I teel you what eet was," he said. "Eet was
monee."</p>

<p>Frank was startled by this sudden appearance of the
boy.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, I watch de Tracy man," returned the lad
craftily. "I see something."</p>

<p>"Were you near enough to hear their talk?"</p>

<p>"Just a leetle beet."</p>

<p>"Ha! What was it? What did you hear?"</p>

<p>"De man with hurt hand he geef oder man monee.
Oder man take eet. Say eet not enough. Must have
two times more as much before he do something man
with hurt hand want heem to do. Man with hurt
hand mad. Eet do no goode. Oder man say breeng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
as much more twice over to heem at same place same
time to-morrow."</p>

<p>It is needless to say that this revelation was intensely
interesting to Merriwell.</p>

<p>"Why, Hop Anson has no money!" exclaimed
Frank. "Where did he get it? It must have come
from Bill. In that case, an attempt is being made to
bribe my foreman. I have a traitor in the mine, and
he means to deliver me into the hands of the enemy."</p>

<p>"Tracy man he say to man with hurt hand that
Pablo, the brother of Gonchita, ees here."</p>

<p>"So Tracy told Anson that?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, I think I need a new foreman&mdash;and need him
bad! It is about time for Mr. Tracy to get out!"</p>

<p>"You wait and watch, you ketch heem."</p>

<p>It was arranged that Pablo should return in advance
to the mine, in order that they might not be seen coming
in together. So the Mexican boy strolled back
with assumed carelessness.</p>

<p>But it happened that Jim Tracy was watching, and
he saw Pablo, whereupon he hastened to meet the
boy.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" harshly demanded the
foreman.</p>

<p>Pablo looked surprised.</p>

<p>"I go to tak' de walk," he said.</p>

<p>"You little liar!" snarled Tracy. "You have been
playing the spy! I know what you have been doing!"</p>

<p>"De spyee&mdash;how you mean?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mexican lad seemed very innocent.</p>

<p>"I've seen you sneaking around. Why are you
hanging around here, anyhow? Why don't you get
out?"</p>

<p>"Dat none of your busineeze," returned the lad
saucily.</p>

<p>"You little runt!" growled Tracy, catching the boy
by the shoulder. "Do you dare talk to me that way?"</p>

<p>"You beeg rufeen!" cried Pablo. "You hurt! Let
of me a-go!"</p>

<p>Then he kicked the foreman on the shins. Immediately,
with a roar of rage, Tracy struck Pablo with
his fist, knocking the boy down.</p>

<p>Pablo was armed with a pistol, and this weapon he
snatched out when he scrambled to his feet. But
Tracy was on hand to clutch him and wrest the
weapon from his grasp.</p>

<p>"You little devil!" grated the man. "I'll cut your
throat on the spot!"</p>

<p>There was a terrible look in his eyes as he whipped
out a knife and lifted it.</p>

<p>"Drop that!"</p>

<p>Crack!&mdash;the report of a revolver emphasized the
command, and the bullet struck the knife and tore it
from the hand of the aroused ruffian.</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell had arrived just in time to save
Pablo, who was bent helplessly backward over Tracy's
knee, the hand of the wretch being at his throat.</p>

<p>Tracy shook his benumbed and quivering hand, releasing
the boy and looking at Frank resentfully.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you're not badly hurt!" said Merry, as he
strode up. "My lead struck the knife blade, not your
hand. And I seemed to be barely in time, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wasn't going to hurt the kid!" declared
Tracy harshly. "I was going to teach him a lesson,
that was all. I wanted to frighten him a little."</p>

<p>"Well, your behavior looked remarkably bloodthirsty.
You seemed on the point of drawing the knife
across his throat. That was enough for me. You
may go, Tracy, but you are to let Pablo alone in the
future."</p>

<p>"If he insults me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Report to me; I'll make him apologize. Go."</p>

<p>Tracy seemed to wish to linger to argue over the
matter, but the look in Merriwell's eyes forbade it,
and he picked up the knife and slouched sullenly away.</p>

<p>"I hope he did not hurt you much," said Frank, lifting
Pablo's hat to see the bruise made by the ruffian's
fist.</p>

<p>With a cry, the boy grasped his hat and pulled it
down upon his head.</p>

<p>But Frank had made a most surprising discovery,
and it was enough to give Merry something to meditate
over.</p>

<p>He decided that the boy must be closely watched,
and he longed for the presence of old Joe Crowfoot,
than whom no one was more fitted to such a task.</p>

<p>But the outlaws had averred that old Joe was "food
for buzzards," and the protracted absence of the redskin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
led Merry to fear that he had looked into the
Indian's beady eyes for the last time.</p>

<p>Frank spoke to no one of his discovery. As far
as possible, he kept his eyes on Pablo, as if he believed
the boy meditated treachery of some sort.</p>

<p>Frank's friends wandered about the place and investigated
the mine, watching operations.</p>

<p>The calm of the valley was most deceptive, and both
Ready and Gallup declared they could not conceive any
possible danger lurking near. Hodge, however, professed
to feel a warning in the very peacefulness, which
he declared was the calm before a storm.</p>

<p>Jim Tracy sulked. His treatment by Frank was
altogether displeasing to him, and he felt that he
had been humiliated, which caused him to register a
secret vow of vengeance.</p>

<p>Pablo was generally found lingering about Frank's
cabin or somewhere near Merry.</p>

<p>"He knows a good thing when he sees it," said
Ready sagely, "and he means to stick to it. He doesn't
seem in any great hurry about rushing to the rescue
of his 'seestar.'"</p>

<p>Frank smiled in a knowing manner, observing:</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has reasons to know that his sister is
in no great peril at present, and he is satisfied to stay
here."</p>

<p>"He's a gol dern lazy little beggar!" said Gallup.
"An' he oughter hev to wash his face once in a while."</p>

<p>The evening was cool and agreeable. The sun
dropped peacefully behind the mountains and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
shadows gathered deeply in the gorges and cañons.
The roar of the stamps sank to silence, and peace lay
like a prayer on the valley.</p>

<p>Frank and his friends sat about the cabin door and
chatted of old times. Sometimes they sang little
snatches of the old songs.</p>

<p>And as the darkness deepened a slender, boyish
figure lay on his stomach and wiggled cautiously nearer
and nearer, taking the utmost pains not to be seen.</p>

<p>This eavesdropper was Pablo, and he evinced the
greatest interest in all they were saying; but it was
when Frank spoke or sang that he listened with the
utmost attention, keeping perfectly still. Thus it was
that the boy heard Hodge say:</p>

<p>"Merriwell, I'm half-inclined to believe that dirty
little Mexican rascal is a fakir. I suspect him."</p>

<p>"Of what?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"Of being a spy. He told a slick tale, but I've had
time to think it over, and somehow it seems too thin.
Why shouldn't Bill send him here to play the spy?"</p>

<p>"My dear Bart," said Merry, with a laugh, "what
would be Bill's object? What could the boy do?"</p>

<p>"He might get a chance to put a knife in your back,
old man."</p>

<p>"I'll chance it. I do not believe Pablo that bad.
I'll trust him."</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't trust any greaser."</p>

<p>"I hate you, Señor Hodge!" whispered the listening
boy, to himself. "I hate you; but I lofe Frank
Merriwell!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>The miners gathered near their quarters. As far
as possible, Frank had secured miners who were not
Mexicans, but there were a few Mexicans among
them.</p>

<p>Among the men were some who were hard characters
when they were drinking, and Merry had taken
particular pains to make rules and regulations to keep
liquor away from them.</p>

<p>The morning after the encounter between Pablo and
Jim, the foreman, Frank arose and flung open the
door of his cabin, but immediately made the discovery
that a sheet of paper was pinned to the door with a
knife.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he exclaimed. "Here's something interesting!"</p>

<p>Gallup came slouching forward, followed by Ready.</p>

<p>"What, ho!" cried Jack, as his eyes fell on the
knife and the paper. "Methinks I see something!
Hist! That is what the tragic actor said when he
appeared upon the stage. He crept in and looked
around, after which he said, 'Hist!' And he was
hissed."</p>

<p>"By gum!" cried Ephraim. "There's writin' written
on it! What does it say?"</p>

<p>This is what they read written sprawlingly on the
sheet of paper that was pinned to the door by the
knife:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Frank Merriwell</span>: You are hearby giv notis
that you are to send away the boy Pablo instanter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
He promised to come to his sister, and he has not
come. You are warned not to keep him. <span class="smcap">Bill</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Frank looked at the notice and laughed.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "that is rather interesting. So
Bill wants the boy? Why doesn't he come and take
him?"</p>

<p>Hodge came and read the notice, a deep frown on
his darkly handsome face.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Merry?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Give us your opinion."</p>

<p>"Nerve."</p>

<p>"Shall we give up the boy?"</p>

<p>Now Bart had not favored Pablo, but at this juncture
he grimly declared:</p>

<p>"I'm against it."</p>

<p>"Good!" nodded Merry. "Let Bill come and take
him! If the boy's story is true, it would not be a
healthy thing for him to fall into Bill's hands."</p>

<p>Just as he spoke these words Jim Tracy came around
the corner and appeared on the scene. He halted, appearing
surprised, and stared at the knife and the
notice.</p>

<p>"Whatever is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Something left there during the night," said
Merry. "Read it."</p>

<p>Tracy looked it over.</p>

<p>"Well, Bill sure wants the greaser kid," he said, "an'
I reckon you'd best give the youngster up."</p>

<p>"Why do you reckon that?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cimarron Bill is a heap dangerous."</p>

<p>"He may be," said Merry; "but he has failed thus
far to get ahead of me. I don't like his notice, if this
came from him. But I thought you took pains to
have the place guarded at night, Tracy?"</p>

<p>"So I does, sir."</p>

<p>"Then how did Bill or any of his gang manage to
creep up here and pin this to my door?"</p>

<p>"That I can't say, sir."</p>

<p>"I think I'll look after things to-night," said Frank
grimly. "If we're getting careless around here Bill
may walk in some night and seize the mine before we
know a thing of what's going to happen."</p>

<p>He jerked the knife from the door, took the paper
and placed it in his pocket, after which he indicated
that he was ready to speak with the foreman, who had
some matter of business to discuss.</p>

<p>When Tracy departed Frank sat down and meditated,
for he had noticed something peculiar and remarkable.</p>

<p>There were ink-stains upon the thumb and two of
the fingers of Jim Tracy's right hand.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<h3>FRANK DETECTS TREACHERY.</h3>


<p>Needless to say Frank did not send Pablo away.
He did not tell the boy of the warning found on the
door. Instead, he called the Mexican lad and said:</p>

<p>"Pablo, I want you to watch Tracy closely for me.
Will you?"</p>

<p>"Señor Frank can be sure I weel," said the boy.</p>

<p>"If possible, I want you to get some of Tracy's
handwriting and bring it to me."</p>

<p>"Eet I will do, señor."</p>

<p>"But look out for him. He's dangerous. Don't let
him catch you playing the spy."</p>

<p>"I tak' de great care 'bout that."</p>

<p>Before noon the Mexican boy came hurrying to
Merry, his big dark eyes glowing. He caught hold of
Frank's hand and gave it an excited pressure.</p>

<p>"I haf eet!" he said.</p>

<p>"What is it you have?"</p>

<p>"Some of hees writeeng. He do eet in de mine
offeese when he think no one watch heem. I see heem
through window. He put eet in lettare, stick eet up,
put in pocket, then drop um. I know; I watch; I pick
eet up. Here eet ees!"</p>

<p>He thrust into Merry's hand a soiled, sealed and
undirected envelope.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eet ees inside," said Pablo, all aquiver.</p>

<p>"Come in here," said Frank, leading the way into
the cabin.</p>

<p>Bart and Jack were watching Ephraim Gallup at a
distance from the cabin, the Yankee youth being engaged
in a brave attempt to ride a small, bucking
bronco.</p>

<p>When they were inside the cabin, Frank closed and
fastened the door. Making a hasty examination of
the envelope, he quickly lighted a small alcohol-lamp
beneath a tiny brass tea-kettle, which he partly filled
with water.</p>

<p>In a very few moments steam was pouring from the
nozle of the kettle. Holding the envelope in this,
Merry quickly steamed open the flap, taking from it
a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>Pablo's eyes seemed to grow larger than ever as he
watched. Frank unfolded the paper and read:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have decided to except terms, and to-night will
be the time for you to come down on the mine. The
whisky will be yoused to get the men drunk, jest as
you perposed, and I'll hev them all filled up by ten
o'clock. Wate tell you hear three shots right togather,
then charge and you'll take the mine, havin' only
Merywel and his tenderfeet backers to fight, and them
I will hav fastened into their cabin. J."</p></blockquote>

<p>Merry whistled over this, showing no small amount
of surprise.</p>

<p>"Ees de writin' what you expec'?" asked Pablo anxiously.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's somewhat more than I expected," said Frank.
"By Jove! there will be doings here to-night."</p>

<p>He quickly decided on the course he would pursue.
Carefully drying the flap of the envelope, he placed
some fresh mucilage on it, thrust the message into it,
and resealed it carefully.</p>

<p>"See here, Pablo," he said quickly, "if you can do
it, I want you to take this and drop it just where you
found it, so that Tracy will be pretty sure to recover
it. I do not wish him to know that it has been picked
up. Do your best. If you can't do it, come and tell
me."</p>

<p>"I do eet," assured Pablo, as he took the envelope,
concealed it beneath his jacket, and slipped from the
cabin.</p>

<p>Frank had been given something to think about.</p>

<p>"So Tracy has turned traitor," he meditated. "He
has decided to betray the mine into the hands of
Cimarron Bill's gang. It was his writing on the notice
pinned on the door, not Bill's. That notice was a fake,
and it made him angry because it didn't work out as
he planned. Bill got at him through Hop Anson, who
must have been in Bill's employ all along. Well, to-night
is the time I give those ruffians their final setback.
Another repulse will discourage them. They
would have descended on the place while I was in
their power if they had fancied there was any chance
that I might escape with my life."</p>

<p>Pretty soon he walked out, with his hands in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
pockets, and joined his friends, laughing heartily over
Gallup's trials, and seeming undisturbed by any worry.</p>

<p>Later he entered the mine and found that Tracy
was not about. Nor could he discover anything of
Pablo. The afternoon was far spent when the Mexican
boy suddenly appeared before Frank.</p>

<p>"Hello, Pablo!" said Merry. "What's the word?"</p>

<p>"I followe heem," whispered Pablo excitedly. "I
haf drop de letter where he find eet when he look for
eet. Then he find time to go 'way. I followe. I see
heem take letter to place in rocks long distance down
vallee. He hide eet there. Pablo let heem go; stay
watch letter. He haf hoss hid some piece off. He
geet to hoss, geet on heem, ride off."</p>

<p>"That's all?"</p>

<p>"Dhat ees all."</p>

<p>"Well, you have done well, Pablo," said Merry.
"I'll not forget it."</p>

<p>Pablo again grasped Frank's hand, which he kissed.</p>

<p>"You freen' to Pablo," he said. "You goode to
heem. He not forget."</p>

<p>"Tell no one what you have seen and done."</p>

<p>"You look out for Beel."</p>

<p>"You may be sure I'll do that, Pablo. When Bill
comes here, he'll receive a warm reception."</p>

<p>That night after supper, as the miners sat about the
long table in the low, open room, smoking their pipes
and cigarettes and enjoying the grateful coolness of
the evening, Jim Tracy, the foreman, came into the
room and cried:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, boys, you've been working right hard to open
up this yere old mine, an' I appreciates it, if the young
man what owns the property don't. It's a long distance
to town, an' ye can't all git off together to have
a leetle blow, so I has brought ye some good whisky,
and I perposes that you all takes a drink on me."</p>

<p>Saying which, he produced two big quart bottles and
held them above his head, so the lamplight fell upon
them.</p>

<p>Instantly two shots sounded through the place, and
the bottles were smashed in the foreman's hands by a
pair of bullets, the glass flying and the liquor spattering
over him.</p>

<p>In through the doorway at the opposite end of the
room stepped Frank Merriwell, a pistol in each hand.</p>

<p>"Keep your hands up and empty, Jim Tracy!" he
said, in a commanding tone. "It will be unhealthy
for you if you lower them!"</p>

<p>Behind Frank were Bart, Jack, and Ephraim, with
Pablo hovering like a shadow still farther in the rear.</p>

<p>Tracy was astounded.</p>

<p>"What in blazes does this mean!" he snarled, but
he kept his hands up, as Frank had ordered.</p>

<p>"It means that I am onto your game to drug these
boys and betray us all. Steady! If you try to get
a weapon I shall drop you! You know I can shoot
a little. Just tie him up, fellows."</p>

<p>"With the greatest pleasure," chirped Jack Ready,
as he waltzed lightly forward, accompanied by Hodge
and Gallup.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the protests of Tracy, they bound him
hand and foot, so that he could barely wiggle.</p>

<p>The miners had been amazed, but they believed
Merry when he told them of Tracy's plot to betray
the mine.</p>

<p>"He would have drugged you all," said Frank.
"Then, when Bill's gang charged on the mine, it's
likely many of you would have been killed. But what
did he care about that. Now we'll fool Cimarron Bill
and teach him a lesson."</p>

<p>He explained his plan to them, and they readily
agreed. So it happened that, a little later, the miners
began to sing and shout and pretend to be riotously
merry. This they kept up until it seemed as if they
were engaged in a fearful carousal. Then the noises
began to die out and grow less.</p>

<p>It was past ten o'clock when dead silence seemed to
rest on the camp. Frank Merriwell stepped to the
door, lifted his hand and fired three shots into the
air.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the sound of galloping horses
coming up the valley was distinctly heard.</p>

<p>"Here they come!" breathed Frank. "All ready for
them!"</p>

<p>Right up to the mine-buildings charged the horsemen.
They were dismounting when Frank's challenge
rang out sharp and clear:</p>

<p>"Hold, Cimarron Bill! Stop where you are! Stop,
or we fire!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>The outlaws uttered a yell and charged, firing the
first shots.</p>

<p>Then Merry gave the command, and the armed and
waiting miners fired on the raiders. It was a withering
volley, and must have astounded the ruffians.</p>

<p>Bill, however, had come this time determined to
succeed, and he called on his men to break down the
doors. As they were hammering at the front doors,
Frank led some of the men out by the back way and
charged round the buildings.</p>

<p>The encounter that took place was brief and sanguine.
The miners were encouraged by Hodge,
Ready, and Gallup, who fought with savage fury, and
the raiders began to waver.</p>

<p>Suddenly a tall figure came rushing into the thick of
the fight and confronted Frank.</p>

<p>It was Tracy, who had been released from his bonds
by a sympathetic miner.</p>

<p>"Yah!" he snarled, having heard Merry's voice and
recognized him. "So it's you! I've found you! Take
that!"</p>

<p>He pitched forward a revolver and fired pointblank
at Frank.</p>

<p>At that very instant, with a cry, Pablo, the Mexican
boy, leaped in front of Merry.</p>

<p>Struck by the bullet intended for Frank, the little
fellow tossed up his arms and fell backward into Merriwell's
clasp. At the same instant somebody shot
Jim Tracy through the brain.</p>

<p>As Merriwell lowered the death-stricken boy, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
raiders, completely baffled, gave over the attack and
took to flight, leaving half their number behind,
stretched upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt&mdash;badly?" asked Frank, as one of
the boy's arms dropped limply over his neck and
seemed to cling there.</p>

<p>For a moment there was no answer. Then came
the faintly whispered words:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;theenk&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;keeled&mdash;Señor Merriwell."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Gonchita!" said Frank earnestly; "not as
bad as that! It cannot be!"</p>

<p>"You know me," was the surprised whisper. "How
you know I am Gonchita?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I discovered it the other day&mdash;I found you
had your hair tied up beneath your hat. Here, men&mdash;somebody
bring a light! Be lively about it!"</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said one of the men. "Have one
directly."</p>

<p>"No use, Señor Merriwell," came weakly from the
lips of the disguised girl. "I shall be dead in a minute.
<i>Ay-de mi</i>! Poor Gonchita! You theenk she ees
veree bad girl? Beel he say he weel marree her. He
get me to fool you, señor. Then you are so veree
brave! Señor Frank, I theenk you are de han'someest,
de braveest man I evere know. I run away from Beel.
I wear de boyee's clothes an' come here. Dat ees all.
Now I haf to die."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, Gonchita," said Merry, with infinite
pity for the unfortunate girl. "We'll see what can
be done for you."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>She managed to press one of his hands to her lips.</p>

<p>"So goode&mdash;so han'some!" she whispered. "Good-by,
señor! Eet ees ovare."</p>

<p>Then one of the men came out with a lighted lantern;
but before the light fell on the face of the
wounded girl Frank knew he was holding a corpse in
his arms.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the dead was found Hop Anson. Jim
Tracy lay where he had fallen immediately after the
shot which ended the life of poor Gonchita.</p>

<p>Such of the ruffians who were wounded were cared
for as well as possible. The dead were buried there
in the valley.</p>

<p>Cimarron Bill's band was completely broken up.</p>

<p>On his next visit to town Merry had a marble slab
cut for the grave of the Mexican girl, which was located
at a distance from those of the outlaws.</p>

<p>On the slab were chiseled these words: "Poor Gonchita!"</p><hr class="chap" />

<h3>THE WAR-WHOOP OF OLD ELI.</h3>


<p>The afternoon sun lay scorching hot upon the arid
plain. Heat waves moved in the air like the billows
of a phantom sea. To the west were barren mountain-peaks
and the nearer foot-hills; to the east the
unbroken plain lay level to the horizon.</p>

<p>Behind the body of his dead horse lay a sorely
wounded man, with his dog crouching close at his
side. The dog's dry tongue lolled from the animal's
mouth; at times the poor creature whined and sought
to lick the hand of its master; anon he growled fiercely,
the hair bristling on his neck, and started up in a savage
manner.</p>

<p>"Down, Boxer, down!" the man would order, in a
voice ever growing weaker. "You can't help. The
red devils will get you with a bullet. Down, sir!"</p>

<p>At which the dog would sink back, whine again and
draw his filelike tongue along the hand or cheek of
his master.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" muttered the man. "For a swallow of
water. I'd give the last ounce in the saddle-bags if
I could finish one or two more of those murderous curs
before I cash in!"</p>

<p>His almost nerveless hands grasped the barrel of
his rifle, and he looked away toward the spot where six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
horsemen had drawn up in a little cluster just beyond
bullet-reach.</p>

<p>They were Indians, mounted on tough ponies, and
some of them armed with modern weapons. Two or
three carried lances, on which the glaring sun glinted.</p>

<p>They had hunted him down; they had killed the
horse beneath him and wounded him unto death. The
bullet was through his body, and the sands of life
were ebbing fast. He had reached the end of his
trail, and the red fiends out there on the baking plain
knew they had only to wait a while and then ride forward
unmolested and strip off his scalp. Yet, being
far from their reservation, the savages were impatient
at the delay. Their hearts were vengeful within them,
for in the chase he had slain two of their number.</p>

<p>One of them, an impetuous young buck, was for
making haste in finishing the paleface. He motioned
toward the declining sun and suggested that the
wounded man might try to crawl away with the coming
of darkness. Besides, they had far to go, and it
was a waste of time to wait for the paleface to die.
Likely he was so far gone that he could not shoot
to defend himself, and there would be little trouble in
getting near enough to despatch him.</p>

<p>The impetuous spirit of this savage prevailed, and
soon the redskins began riding around and around
man and horse and dog, spreading out into a circle
with great gaps and slowly closing in, now and then
uttering a challenging yell. As they closed in they
flung themselves over upon the sides of their ponies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
opposite the wounded man, so that their horses seemed
riderless. Occasionally a shot was fired from beneath
the neck of a racing pony.</p>

<p>The dying man gathered himself a little and watched
them. A puff of white smoke leaped out before a
pony and was quickly left behind to dissolve and fade
in the heated air. A bullet threw up a bit of dust
within three feet of the white man. The dog bristled
and growled. Another bullet clipped a stalk from a
cactus plant five feet away.</p>

<p>"They're within shooting distance," whispered the
doomed wretch. "Wonder if I've got nerve enough to
drop a pony."</p>

<p>He rested his rifle on the body of the dead horse
and waited. Out on the plain the racing ponies began
to swim in a haze. He could see them indistinctly,
and he brushed a hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm going fast, Boxer," he muttered to the dog.
"My sight is failing! I'm burning inside! And I
know you're choking yourself, poor dog! It's a hard
way to pipe out."</p>

<p>The dog whined sympathetically and pressed closer.
A bullet whistled past the head of the man. He tightened
his grip on his rifle, sought to take aim, and
finally fired.</p>

<p>His bullet went wide of the target he sought, and
a yell of derision floated to his ears through the hot
air.</p>

<p>"No use!" he muttered huskily. "I'm done for!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
It's the finish! They can close right in and wipe me
out!"</p>

<p>The savages seemed to know it, and they were drawing
nearer.</p>

<p>Of a sudden out from the depths of a long barranca,
a mighty fissure in the plain, produced in former ages
by a convulsion of nature, or marking the course of a
river&mdash;out from one end that rose to the surface of
the plain not far from the circling savages, came a
horse and rider. As the rider rose into view he began
shooting with a magazine rifle, and his first bullet
caused a redskin to lose his hold and tumble end
over end in the dirt, while the pony galloped on.</p>

<p>The following Indian stooped and seemed to catch
up his wounded comrade as he swept past.</p>

<p>The lone horseman rode straight at them in a reckless
manner, working his repeater.</p>

<p>A pony was wounded, another plunged forward into
the dirt. In another moment the redskins wheeled
and were in full flight, astounded and demoralized by
the attack, two of the horses carrying double, while
another left drops of blood upon the ground.</p>

<p>The daring paleface uttered a strange war-whoop
of triumph: "Brekekek Co-ax, Co-ax, Yale!"</p>

<p>Never before had those Indians heard such a singular
cry from the lips of a white man. It seemed to
fill them with a mad desire to get away, to flee at
top speed. It struck terror into their hearts, as many
a time the same slogan has struck fear to the hearts
of those battling against Old Eli on some athletic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
field. They urged their ponies forward, and away
they went, scurrying into the distance, with bullets
singing around them.</p>

<p>The man behind the dead horse lifted himself and
strained his bedimmed eyes, seeing the youthful rider
shoot past in pursuit of the savages. The dog rose,
planting his forefeet on the horse's body, and barked
madly.</p>

<p>When he was satisfied that the Indians were in full
retreat, with little thought of turning or offering resistance,
Frank Merriwell, for it was he who had
dashed out of the barranca, drew up and turned about,
galloping back toward the man he had dared so much
to save.</p>

<p>But he had come too late.</p>

<p>As Merry rode near the dying man had fallen back
beside his dead horse. Over him stood the dog, covered
with dust, its eyes glaring redly, its teeth disclosed,
ready to defend the body of its master. As
Frank drew up the dog snarled fiercely.</p>

<p>Merry saw at a glance that the situation of the
dog's master was serious in the extreme. He dismounted
and stepped forward, leaving his horse,
knowing well the animal would stand. As he approached
the dog grew fiercer of aspect, and he saw
the creature meant to leap straight at his throat.</p>

<p>"Good dog!" he said, stopping. "Fine dog! Come,
sir&mdash;come! Ah-ha, fine fellow!"</p>

<p>But all his attempts to win the confidence of the
dog were failures.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"The man is dying," he muttered. "Perhaps I might
save him if I could get to him now. Must I shoot
that dog? I hate to do it, for the creature seems
very intelligent."</p>

<p>At this moment the man stirred a little and seemed
to realize what was happening. He lifted his head
a little and saw the dismounted horseman and the
threatening dog.</p>

<p>"Down, Boxer; down, sir!" he commanded. "Be
quiet!"</p>

<p>His voice rose scarcely above a whisper, but the dog
reluctantly obeyed, still keeping his eyes on Frank,
who now stepped up at once.</p>

<p>"You're badly wounded, sir," he said. "Let me
see if I can do anything for you."</p>

<p>"Give me water&mdash;for the love of Heaven, water!"
was the harshly whispered imploration.</p>

<p>In a twinkling Frank sprang to his horse and
brought back a canteen that was well filled. This he
held to the lips of the wretched man, while the crouching
dog watched every move with his red eyes.</p>

<p>That water, warm though it was, brought back a
little life to the sinking man.</p>

<p>"God bless you!" he murmured gratefully.</p>

<p>The dog whined.</p>

<p>"Can't you give Boxer a little?" asked the dog's
master. "He's suffering as much as I am."</p>

<p>Frank quickly removed from his saddle-bags a deep
tin plate, on which some of the water was poured, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
this the dog greedily licked up, wagging his tail in
thankfulness.</p>

<p>"Poor old Boxer!" sighed the doomed man.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said the youth, "let me examine your
wound and find out what I can do for you."</p>

<p>"No use," was the declaration. "I'm done for. It's
through the lung, and I've bled enough to finish two
men. The blood is all out of me."</p>

<p>But the young man insisted on looking and did what
he could to check the flow of blood.</p>

<p>The doomed man shook his head a little.</p>

<p>"No use," he repeated. "I'm going now&mdash;I feel it.
But you have done all you could for Old Bens, and you
won't lose nothing by it. What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Frank Merriwell."</p>

<p>"Well, Pard Merriwell, you sure went for those
red devils right hot. I allowed at first that you must
have four or five friends with ye."</p>

<p>"I'm alone."</p>

<p>"And it was great grit for you to charge the red
skunks that way. However did you happen to do it?"</p>

<p>"I saw what was going on from the high land to the
west with the aid of a powerful glass. I knew they
had a white man trapped here. I struck the barranca
and managed to get down into it, so I was able to ride
close without being seen and charge up from this end,
where it rises to the level of the plain. That is all."</p>

<p>"It was nerve, young man, and plenty of it! My
name is Benson Clark. I'm a miner. Been over in the
Mazatzals. Struck it rich, young pard&mdash;struck it rich.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
There was no one but me and old Boxer, my dog.
I took out a heap of dust, and I opine I located a
quartz claim that certainly is worth a hundred thousand
dollars, or I'm away off. Been a miner all my
life. Grub-staked it from the Canadian line to Mexico.
Have managed to live, but this is my first strike. No
one staked me this time, so it's all mine. But see, pard,
what black luck and those red devils have done for
me! I'm finished, and I'll never live to enjoy a dollar
of my wealth. Pretty tough, eh?"</p>

<p>"Pretty tough," admitted Frank Merriwell; "but
brace up. Who can tell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can. Bens Clark is at the end of his trail.
Young man, I want you to see me properly planted.
You'll find enough in the saddle-bags here and in the
belt around my waist to pay you for your trouble."</p>

<p>"I want no pay, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon you may as well have it, as I have
neither kith nor kin in the wide world, and most of my
friends have cashed in ahead of me, so I'm left all
alone&mdash;me and Boxer."</p>

<p>The dying man lifted his hand with a great effort
and caressed the dog.  The animal whined and snuggled
nearer, fixing his eyes on his master's face with
an expression of devotion and anxiety that was quite
touching to see.</p>

<p>"Good old Boxer!" sighed the man, with deep feeling.
"You'll miss me, boy, and you're the only one
in all the wide world. What will become of you,
Boxer?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the dog whined a little, touching the bloodless
cheek of the man with its tongue.</p>

<p>"I'll do what I can for your dog, sir," said Frank
Merriwell.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Will you take Boxer and
care for him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Do it! You'll never be sorry. You'll find him the
most faithful, devoted, and intelligent of dumb animals.
Truly, he knows almost as much as a man&mdash;more
than lots of men. It's a shame he can't talk!
He knows what I say to him almost always. I've almost
fancied he might be taught to talk; but that's
ridiculous, I know. Take him, Frank Merriwell, treat
him well, and you'll never regret it."</p>

<p>The dog seemed listening. He looked from one to
the other in a peculiar manner, and then, as if realizing
what had passed and that he was soon to part
with his master forever, he uttered a whining howl
that was doleful and pathetic.</p>

<p>"Poor old Boxer&mdash;good boy!" said Benson Clark.
"I've got to go, boy."</p>

<p>The dog crept close, and the dying man weakly
folded the animal in his arms.</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell turned away. The sunlight was
so bright and strong on the plain that it seemed to
cause him to brush a hand over his eyes. He stood
looking far off for some moments, but was given a
start by hearing a weak call from the man.</p>

<p>"I'm going!" breathed Clark huskily. "Here&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
my pocket here you will find a rude chart that may
lead you to my rich mines in the Mazatzals. Feel in
my pocket for the leather case. That's it. Take it&mdash;keep
it. It's yours. The mines are yours&mdash;if you can
find them. Boxer is yours. Be good to him. Poor
old Boxer!"</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and lay so still that Frank fancied
the end had come. But it was not yet. After a
little he slowly opened his eyes and looked at Merry.
Immediately Frank knelt beside him, with uncovered
head.</p>

<p>The dying man then looked at the dog.</p>

<p>"Boxer," he said faintly, "I'm going off on my long
trail, and we'll never meet up again this side of the
happy hunting-grounds. Good-by, old dog! This is
your new master. Stick to him like glue, old boy.
Fight for him&mdash;die for him, if you have to. I opine
you understand what I mean."</p>

<p>A strange sound came from the throat of the dog&mdash;a
sound that was almost like a human sob. If ever
a dog sobbed that one did. Agony and sorrow was
depicted in his attitude and the look in its red eyes.</p>

<p>The miner took the dog's paw and placed it in
Frank Merriwell's hand, his body lying between them.</p>

<p>"I make you pards," said Benson Clark.</p>

<p>Then he whispered to Frank:</p>

<p>"Can't you pray? I've clean forgot all the prayers
I ever knew. But I feel that I need a prayer said for
me now, for I'm going up before the judgment bar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Pray, partner&mdash;pray to the Great Judge that He will
be easy with me."</p>

<p>So Frank Merriwell prayed, and that prayer fell
upon the heart of the dying man with such soothing
balm that all fear and dread left him, and he passed
into the great unknown with a peaceful smile on his
weather-worn face.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<h3>A STRANGE FUNERAL.</h3>


<p>Frank found the saddle-bags and the belt about the
dead man's waist heavy with gold. It took him some
time to make preparations for transporting the precious
stuff, and it was no easy task for him to quiet
his horse and induce the animal to stand while he lifted
the corpse and placed it where it could be tied securely
on the horse's back.</p>

<p>He had no thought of leaving the body of Benson
Clark to be devoured by wolves and vultures.</p>

<p>The sun was resting close down to the blue tops of
the western mountains when everything was ready to
start.</p>

<p>The dog had watched every move with eyes full of
singular intelligence, but made no move or sound until
Merry was ready to go.</p>

<p>Then Frank turned more water from the canteen,
after taking a few swallows himself, placing it before
Boxer in the tin plate. The dog licked it up.</p>

<p>"Good Boxer!" said Merry, patting the beast's head.
"I'm your master now, my boy. Your other master
is dead. He has told you to stick to me. Did you
understand?"</p>

<p>The dog made some strange swallowing and mumbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
sounds in its throat, as if trying to talk back
in words.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Merry, gazing at the creature with
great interest. "You are a knowing fellow, and you
actually try to talk. Your master fancied you might
be taught to talk."</p>

<p>Again those strange swallowings and mumblings issued
from the dog's throat, and the creature wagged
its tail a little.</p>

<p>"We'll go now," said Frank. "It's a good distance
to the mine, and we have something to do before we
can set out in earnest."</p>

<p>So they started off, Frank leading the horse bearing
the ghastly burden, while the dog walked behind
with hanging head, the perfect picture of sorrow.</p>

<p>A strange funeral procession it was, making its way
toward the setting sun and the hazy mountains. The
dead horse was left behind, while far in the sky
wheeled two black specks, buzzards waiting for the
feast.</p>

<p>The Indians had long vanished from the face of the
plain, yet Frank knew their nature, and he was not at
all sure he had seen the last of them.</p>

<p>The sun vanished behind the mountains and the blue
night lay soft and soothing on the hot plain when the
funeral procession came into the foot-hills.</p>

<p>It was not Frank's intention to carry the dead man
farther than was needful, and, therefore, he kept his
eyes about him for some place to bestow the body
where it might rest safe from prowling beasts.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>This place he found at last, and, with the aid of a
flat stone, and with his bare hands, he scooped a shallow
grave. Into this the body was fitted. Over the
man's face Frank spread his own handkerchief. Then
he besprinkled the dry earth lightly over the body at
first, afterward using the flat rock to scrape and shovel
more upon it, ending with covering it heavily with such
stones as he could find, knowing well with what skill
the ravening beasts of the desert could use their claw-armed
paws.</p>

<p>For a time the dog sat and watched everything.
When his late master was placed in the grave he whined
and cried softly; but when the body was covered he
lay down beside the grave in silence, and there was in
his posture something so heartbroken that Frank was
moved to a great pity.</p>

<p>"Poor old Boxer!" he murmured. "It is the end
to which all living things must come, each in its own
time.  But it is the law of nature, and it is not so bad,
after all. Blessed is he who goes to his last deep sleep
without fear, feeling that he has done his best and is
willing to trust everything in the hands of Him who
sees and knows all. The fear of death and what may
follow is such as should trouble alone the coward or
the wicked wretch. Boxer, your master seemed to pass
without fear, and something tells me it is not so bad
with him. His case is in the hands of the Great
Judge, and we may rest sure that he will be done no
wrong."</p>

<p>Was there ever such a strange funeral oration! A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
youth with bared head and solemn face, speaking above
a grave, and a silent, grief-stricken dog as the only
mourner and attendant! The still Arizona night all
around, with no sound of humming insect, no stir of
foliage, no whisper of moving breeze, the dome of
heaven above, studded with millions of clear stars!
The dog did not move or lift its head, but Frank
saw the starshine glint upon his eyes, which were wide
open and fastened upon the speaker.</p>

<p>When the work was completed Frank knelt for a
moment beside that grave, praying softly, yet with an
earnestness that bespoke his faith that his words were
heard.</p>

<p>It was over. His horse was at a little distance. He
went and brought the animal up and adjusted the saddle.
The dead man's belt, stuffed to bursting and wondrous
heavy, he had fastened about his own waist.</p>

<p>"Come, Boxer," he said, again stooping to pat the
head of the dog. "We must go. Bid farewell to your
master's grave. It's not likely you may ever again
come beside it."</p>

<p>The dog stirred. He sat up and lifted his muzzle
toward the stars. From his throat came a low note
that rose and swelled to the most doleful sound imaginable.</p>

<p>With his blood chill in his body, Frank listened
while the dog sang a requiem above that grave. Tears
started from Merry's eyes, and never while life was
his could he forget that sound and that sight. Never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
chanted words of mass had more of sorrow! No
human tongue could speak greater grief.</p>

<p>At last the sound died away into silence, and the
dog stood on all fours, with hanging head and tail,
his muzzle kissing some of the rough stones heaped on
that grave. How long he might have remained in that
attitude cannot be said; but soon Frank spoke again
and called him to follow. At the word he turned, and
his manner denoted he was ready.</p>

<p>Merry swung into the saddle and started, looking
over his shoulder. In dead silence, the dog followed.</p>

<p>And so they passed into the still night.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<h3>NEW ARRIVALS IN HOLBROOK.</h3>


<p>The town of Holbrook had been greatly stirred. It
had not yet settled into its accustomed grooves. The
proprietor of the best hotel in town had received a
consignment of fine furniture, carpets, draperies, wallpaper
and pictures, and he had set about renovating
and decorating several of the largest rooms in his
house, having for that purpose a number of workmen
imported from some Eastern point. It was said that
the rooms had been rearranged to connect with each
other in a suite, and that when they were completed,
and furnished, and decorated they were dazzlingly
magnificent, nothing like them ever before having
been seen in the place. The good citizens of Holbrook
wondered and were amazed at all this; but they did
not know that not one dollar had been expended by
the proprietor of the hotel. All this work had been
done without expense of his to accommodate some
guests who came in due time and took possession of
those rooms.</p>

<p>The California Special had dropped four persons in
Holbrook, who regretfully left the comfort of a palace
car and looked about them with some show of dismay
on the cluttered streets and crude buildings of the
Southwestern town. Holbrook was even better in general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
appearance than many Western towns, but, contrasted
with clean, orderly, handsome Eastern villages,
it was offensive to the eyes of the proud lady who was
aided from the steps of the car and descended to the
station platform with the air of a queen. She turned
up her aristocratic nose a little on glancing around.</p>

<p>This woman was dressed in the height of fashion,
although somewhat too heavily for the country she
now found herself in; but there was about her an air
of display that betokened a lack of correct taste, which
is ever pronounced in those who seek to attract attention
and produce astonishment and awe. She had gray
hair and a cold, unattractive face. Still there was
about her face something that plainly denoted she had
been in her girlhood very attractive.</p>

<p>She was followed by a girl who was so pretty and
so modest in appearance that the rough men who beheld
her gasped with astonishment. Never in the history
of the town had such a pretty girl placed her
foot within its limits. She had a graceful figure, fine
complexion, Cupid-bow mouth, flushed cheeks, large
brown eyes and hair in which there was a hint of red-gold,
in spite of its darkness.</p>

<p>A colored maid followed them.</p>

<p>From another car descended a thin, wiry, nervous
man, who had a great blue beak of a nose, and who
hastened to join the trio, speaking to them.</p>

<p>The hotel proprietor had at the station the finest
carriage he could find, and this whisked them away
to the hotel as soon as they had entered it, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the loungers about the station wondering, while the
train went diminishing into the distance, flinging its
trail of black smoke against the blue of the Arizona
sky.</p>

<p>At the hotel the lady and her daughter occupied two
of the finest rooms, the colored maid another, less expensively
furnished, and the man with the blue nose
was given the fourth.</p>

<p>Holbrook wondered what it meant.</p>

<p>The lady ordered a meal to be served in her rooms.</p>

<p>The report went forth at once, and again Holbrook
stood agog.</p>

<p>The hotel register was watched. Finally the man
with the restless eyes and blue beak entered the office
and wrote nervously in the register.</p>

<p>Barely was he gone when a dozen persons were
packed about the desk, seeking to look over one another's
shoulders to see what had been written.</p>

<p>"Whatever is it, Hank?" asked one. "You sure
kin read writin'. Whatever do you make o' it?"</p>

<p>"'Mrs. D. Roscoe Arlington,' the fust name," said
the one called Hank. "Then comes 'Miss Arlington,'
arter which is 'Mr. Eliot Dodge,' an' lastly I sees 'Hannah
Jackson.'"</p>

<p>"Which last must be the nigger woman," said one
of the rough men.</p>

<p>"I allows so," nodded Hank. "An' it 'pears to me
that name o' Arlington is some familiar. I somehow
thinks I has heard it."</p>

<p>"Why, to be course you has!" said another of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
men. "D. Roscoe Arlington, did you say? Who
hasn't heerd that name? He's one o' them big guns
what has so much money he can't count it to save his
gizzard. Ev-rybody has heerd o' D. Roscoe Arlington.
If he keeps on gittin' rich the way he has the past
three years or so, old Morgan won't be in the game.
Why, this Arlington may now be the richest man in
this country, if ev'rything were rightly known about
him. He owns railroads, an' mines, an' ships, an'
manufacturin' plants, an' nobody knows what all."</p>

<p>"That sartin explains a whole lot the fixin' up that
has been a-doin' around this ranch," said a little man
with a thirsty-looking mouth. "They was a-preparin'
fer the wife o' this mighty rich gent."</p>

<p>"But say!" exclaimed a young fellow with a wicked
face, "ain't she got a slick-lookin' gal with her, what?"</p>

<p>Some of them laughed and slapped him on the
back.</p>

<p>"Go on, Pete!" cried one chap. "You're a gay one
with greaser gals, but you won't be able to make a
wide trail with that yar young lady, so don't be lookin'
that way."</p>

<p>"Wonder whatever could 'a' brought such people
here," speculated a man with tobacco juice on his chin.
"They must mean to stay a while, else they'd never
had them rooms fixed up the way they are."</p>

<p>A ruffianly-looking man with a full beard broke into
a low laugh.</p>

<p>"Why, ain't none o' you heard about the fight what's
bein' made to git holt o' a certain mine not so very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
fur from yere?" he asked. "I mean the mine owned
by a young chap what calls himself Frank Merriwell.
You oughter know somethin' about that."</p>

<p>"Why, 'pears to me," observed the fellow with tobacco
juice on his chin&mdash;"'pears to me I did hear that
thar was trouble over a mine somewhar down in the
Mogollons, an' that Cimarron Bill had been sent to
take it."</p>

<p>"He was sent," said the full-bearded man.</p>

<p>"Then I 'lows he took it, fer Bill's sure to do any
job he tackles."</p>

<p>"He ain't took it none. Frank Merriwell is still
a-holdin' the mine, an' Bill has had his troubles, leavin'
a good part o' his backers stiff arter the ruction."</p>

<p>"Say you so? Waal, this Merriwell sure must be a
hot fighter. But Bill will down him in the end, an'
you kin bet your last simoleon on that."</p>

<p>To which the man with the full beard said nothing.</p>

<p>"All this don't explain any to me jest why this lady
an' her party is hyer," said the one with the thirsty
mouth.</p>

<p>"It ain't noways likely she's lookin' arter Cimarron
Bill none," said another.</p>

<p>"Whoever is a-takin' my name in vain?" demanded
a voice that made them all start and turn toward the
door.</p>

<p>"It's Cimarron Bill hisself!" gasped one, in a whisper.</p>

<p>And the entire crowd seemed awe-stricken and
afraid.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<h3>MRS. ARLINGTON HAS A VISITOR.</h3>


<p>The black maid stood over the little table at which
mother and daughter sat taking tea.</p>

<p>"Sugar, Jackson," said the lady wearily.</p>

<p>The maid lifted the sugar-bowl, but, finding no
tongs, was compelled to use a spoon.</p>

<p>"Why don't you use the tongs, Jackson?" asked the
woman.</p>

<p>"Dar am no tongs, ma'am," answered the maid.</p>

<p>"No tongs? no tongs?" exclaimed Mrs. Arlington,
in astonished surprise. "And I directed that everything
should be prepared here&mdash;that we should have
every convenience of a first-class hotel. Dear me!
Why, I've found nothing right! The hardship of
spending some days in such a place will prostrate me.
I know it will!"</p>

<p>"But why have you come here, mother?" asked June
Arlington, in a voice that denoted culture and a refined
nature. "I cannot understand it. You told me
in the first place that you were going to Mexico.
Then I heard you urging father to come here. When
he said it was not possible, you seemed to get angry,
and you declared that you would come here yourself.
But why should you come because he could not? That
I wonder at."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"He would not!" exclaimed Mrs. Arlington, sipping
her tea. "It was his duty. Never mind the particulars,
June; you may know some time, but not now."</p>

<p>"And I did not wish to come here, mother. You
knew that."</p>

<p>"My daughter, I have decided that it is necessary
to keep you with me. I determined on that after your
surprising behavior the last time you went to Fardale.
You deceived me, June! I cannot forget that."</p>

<p>The words were spoken with cold severity. June
flushed a little.</p>

<p>"It was for Chester's good, as I explained to you,"
she said somewhat warmly. "He has never thanked
me for it, yet it is I who have kept him in Fardale
Academy. Had I not entreated Dick Merriwell to be
easy with him, Chester must have been compelled to
leave or be expelled before this."</p>

<p>"I cannot believe that, June. But, were it true, it is
no excuse for your action. I want no favors from
either of the Merriwells. I will accept nothing from
them! Dick Merriwell is my boy's enemy, and he
shall know what it is to have an Arlington for a foe.
I have determined on that. I repeat that I'll accept
nothing from him."</p>

<p>"Once&mdash;&mdash;" June stopped short. She had been on
the verge of telling her mother that once that lady
had accepted something from Dick Merriwell&mdash;her
life! For, as Mrs. Arlington slipped on the icy platform
of the railway-station at Fardale and was falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
beneath the wheels of a moving train, Dick had grasped
and held her till the cars passed and she was safe.</p>

<p>But June had seen her mother turn blue with anger
at mention of this affair, so she checked herself now,
not wishing to arouse the lady.</p>

<p>Tea was finished in silence, mother and daughter
being occupied with their thoughts.</p>

<p>The maid moved softly about the table.</p>

<p>They had just finished when there came a tap on
the door.</p>

<p>"See who it is, Jackson," directed Mrs. Arlington.</p>

<p>The man with the blue beak was at the door.</p>

<p>"I must speak with Mrs. Arlington," he said, and
entered, hat in hand.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mr. Dodge?" asked the lady, frowning
coldly and plainly annoyed.</p>

<p>Eliot Dodge paused and looked at June significantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it a private matter?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>Flushing a bit, June arose at once and withdrew,
from the room.</p>

<p>"William Lamson has arrived in town, and demands
to see you," said Dodge, when June had disappeared,
the maid having likewise withdrawn.</p>

<p>"That man?" said Mrs. Arlington, with a little start
and a slight shiver. "I have brought you to do the
business with him. You are a regular attorney of the
C. M. A. of A., and you have my instructions."</p>

<p>"So I told him."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>"He refused pointblank to do any business whatever
with me."</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"Yes. I talked to him pretty straight until&mdash;ahem!&mdash;until
I could say no more."</p>

<p>"You could say no more?"</p>

<p>"No, madam; it was impossible."</p>

<p>"Why impossible?"</p>

<p>"He had drawn and cocked a revolver and pointed it
at me. He told me to shut up and take word from
him to you at once or he would shoot me."</p>

<p>"What a dreadful creature!"</p>

<p>"He is, indeed, madam; he's a typical ruffian of the
worst sort."</p>

<p>"And, therefore, the very man to accomplish the
work," said she, with growing interest. "But I dislike
very much to have dealings with such a fellow."</p>

<p>"I thoroughly understand that, madam."</p>

<p>"You might attend to the matter fully as well."</p>

<p>"That is true, Mrs. Arlington."</p>

<p>"You told him so?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"And still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And still he drew a gun on me. He is bound to
see you. He says he will, and I am sure he is a man
to make his word good. Really I don't know how you
are going to get out of it."</p>

<p>"Then I shall not try," said the lady, composing herself.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll see him."</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Now?"</p>

<p>"Send him up at once. I may as well have it over."</p>

<p>Eliot Dodge hesitated.</p>

<p>"I shall be in my room," he said. "If you need
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand. Go bring this man to my door."</p>

<p>Dodge departed, and Mrs. Arlington waited. When
there came a knock on the door she coldly said:</p>

<p>"Come in!"</p>

<p>Cimarron Bill entered the room!</p>

<p>Mrs. Arlington had not called her servant to let
this man in. She glanced toward the door of the room
into which her daughter had retired, and the look on
her face was one of apprehension. Cimarron Bill was
a wicked man, as his every aspect betokened, and this
woman could not think without shame that June should
have any knowledge of her dealings with such a creature.</p>

<p>So she arose hastily, which was quite unlike her, and
crossed the floor to close the door, a strange thing,
considering that she seldom did a thing that another
could do for her.</p>

<p>When June was thus shut out, the woman recrossed
the floor to likewise close the door of the room into
which the colored maid had retired.</p>

<p>All the while Cimarron Bill, hat in hand, stood
watching her closely with his evil eyes. For him it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
must have been a most exceedingly strange thing to
come thus into the presence of a woman whose husband
was known far and wide as a money king, a
woman whose every wish that wealth could serve was
sure to be granted almost as quickly as expressed.</p>

<p>When she had closed the doors she turned about and
faced him, surveying him from head to feet with her
cold and penetrating eyes. He looked back at her with
a sort of boldness, for this man was not one to be in
the least downcast in the presence of a human being
of whatever degree.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arlington motioned toward a chair.</p>

<p>"Will you sit down, sir?" she invited.</p>

<p>"Thank you, madam," said Bill, casting aside the
rough manner of speech that he sometimes assumed
and now using very decent English. "I don't care if
I do."</p>

<p>Whereupon he placed his hat upon the table and
sat upon a chair, with a certain pantherish undulation
of his body, as if his muscles flowed beneath his skin.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dodge saw you," said the woman, remaining
standing. "I directed him to inform you that he was
my accredited agent and prepared to transact any business
with you. I thought it better for him to attend
to this affair."</p>

<p>"And I, madam, if you will excuse me, thought it
best that we should come face to face and have our
dealings thus. That is why I declined to do any business
whatever with the gent with the blue nose."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did not suppose it would be necessary for me to
go so far into this matter until I was informed of your
failure to take possession of the property that rightfully
belongs to the Consolidated Mining Association
of America. I must say, sir, that I am very much
displeased over your failure."</p>

<p>"And you can be no more so than am I myself,"
returned Bill, civilly enough, yet with a sort of boldness
that did not please her, as she was accustomed to
much deference and respect. "But you must know it
is difficult, even in this country, to find men who are
eager to put on themselves the brand of outlaws, and
I acknowledge that my force was not sufficient. The
young dog is a stiff fighter, and that I had not counted
on, him being a tenderfoot to a certain degree&mdash;though,"
he added, as if on second thought, "he's not
so very tender, after all."</p>

<p>"You were told to collect an army, if necessary. Mr.
Dodge informs me that you were directed to get together
a force sufficient to make failure out of the
question. Yet you were repulsed and beaten off when
you went to seize the mine."</p>

<p>"Twice," said Bill grimly. "And the second time
a full half of my men were dropped cold or hurt so
bad that they were put out of the fight. It was not
just my fault that I failed then, for the treachery of
a Mexican girl betrayed my plans to Merriwell, so he
was ready with a trap when I expected to take him
by surprise. That is how it came about, madam. I
had his foreman bribed and should have walked into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
possession of the mine with little or no trouble but for
the girl I mention. It was a bad piece of business."</p>

<p>"Bad!" she exclaimed, nodding a little. "It was
very unfortunate!"</p>

<p>"A word that scarce expresses it, madam. The rest
of my men, the curs, with one or two exceptions, weakened
and gave it up as a bad job. And then, on top
of that, I was informed that the syndicate had grown
disinclined to press the matter further in such a manner,
fearing to get itself into serious trouble."</p>

<p>"That's it!" said the woman sharply. "But I have
taken hold of this matter. The syndicate seems willing
to obtain the mine by some other and slower
method. I am not. I cannot brook delay! I have a
reason why I wish the taking of the mine with the
smallest possible delay, and it makes no difference to
me how the work is accomplished. That is why I am
here on the scene of action. I shall remain here until
I triumph! If you are able to accomplish the work,
well and good. If you are not, then another man
must be found for it."</p>

<p>Cimarron Bill smiled in a most evil manner.</p>

<p>"Madam," he said, "I think you will have trouble
to find in all this country another man so well prepared
to accomplish the task."</p>

<p>"Yet you confess that you have failed twice."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"For which reason," he averred, "I am all the more
dangerous. There is an old saying that the third time
never fails. I am ready for the third trial."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you speak this way. What will
you do?"</p>

<p>"Gather a stronger force and lay my plans so there
can be no failure."</p>

<p>"It is well."</p>

<p>"But that will take much money, madam. You have
it at your command. It is almost certain that all of
us, to the last man, will bear the brand of outlaws. We
may be hunted. It may be necessary for me to hasten
into Mexico and lose myself there for a time. I must
have money in abundance for myself. As for the men
who take part with me, they will all demand high
prices. When it is over and the mine is delivered into
the possession of the syndicate, I shall not trouble
about any one save myself. The men who are with
me may look out for themselves."</p>

<p>This was said in a most cold-blooded manner, speaking
plainly the real character of the wretch.</p>

<p>"I care nothing about that," said the woman. "Fix
that matter as you choose. How much money will
you require?"</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Bill, as if meditating. "It will
take, I am sure, at least fifty men. They may be got
at various prices, some more, some less; but there will
be the bringing of them together and other expenses.
I should say that they must cost at least two hundred
dollars each, which makes a pretty little sum of
ten thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Then it will cost ten thousand dollars?" said Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Arlington quickly. "I'll draw the sum from my own
private account."</p>

<p>"Wait a bit, madam," said the chief of desperadoes.
"I have reckoned for the men, but that does not include
myself. I have said that I must be well paid.
I value myself quite as much as fifty common men,
and that is another ten thousand, or twenty thousand
dollars in all, for which sum I am ready to undertake
the job. I'll add, also, that I guarantee it shall not
fail this time."</p>

<p>It seemed that such a sum must have staggered the
woman. Indeed, her face went a trifle pale, but her
lips were pressed together, and she coldly said:</p>

<p>"It is a bargain! You shall have the money, but
not until you have accomplished the work. Understand
that, not until the work is done!"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

<h3>SEEN FROM THE WINDOW.</h3>


<p>Never before had there been such a bargain between
such a man and such a woman. It was the strangest
compact on record. And no wonder Mrs. Arlington
had closed the doors that her daughter and
her maid should not hear! Had June known all she
must have turned with loathing and horror from the
woman.</p>

<p>Had D. Roscoe Arlington known he must have
been shocked and heart-torn beyond measure. Had he
known he must have wondered if this woman had
matured from the sweet country girl who once declared
with blushes and hanging head that love in a cottage
with him was all the happiness she asked. Had
he known he might have remembered the soft moonlight
night in June when beneath the fragrant lilacs
they plighted their troth, and surely his gold-hardened
heart would have melted with anguish over the frightful
change.</p>

<p>In truth, Mrs. Arlington had become deranged, as
it were, on one point. Her son was her idol. She
had petted, and flattered, and spoiled him. She had
sent him off to school at Fardale with the conviction
that he was certain to rise superior to all other boys
there. And from him she had come to learn that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
had not risen, but had been imposed upon, defeated,
baffled, and held down by another lad who was the recognized
leader in the school. Into the ears of his astonished
and angry mother Chester Arlington had poured his tale
of woe, and it had filled her soul with intense hatred
for this other boy by the name of Merriwell who had
dared think himself better than her Chester. She had
gone to Fardale to set things about as they should be,
and had failed. That seemed to fill her with such
bitterness that she was quite robbed of sober
judgment and reason.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Arlington learned that the mining syndicate
had claims to the mines belonging to Frank and
Dick Merriwell, she was aroused. When she came to
understand that the taking of those mines by the syndicate
would leave the Merriwell brothers almost penniless
and would be the signal for Dick Merriwell to
leave Fardale, she determined that the thing should be
brought about at any cost of money, or time, or
trouble to herself.</p>

<p>And it was in pursuit of this determination that the
wife of D. Roscoe Arlington had come to Arizona and
placed herself face to face with a ruffian like Cimarron
Bill, with whom she now struck a bargain that was
most astounding.</p>

<p>Was the woman in her right mind?</p>

<p>It made little difference to Bill if she were sane or
not, as long as he obtained possession of that money.
But when he asked for it in advance she smiled upon
him coldly, almost scornfully.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were paid money by the syndicate, and you
pledged them to accomplish a task at which you failed.
This time there will be no money forthcoming until the
work is done."</p>

<p>In return the man smiled back at her, and he said:</p>

<p>"That settles it! I'm not a fool. When the work
is done I may find myself on the run for Mexico,
with the law reaching for me. In such a case I'll have
no time to collect. Cash in advance is my motto.
You'll bargain with me, or you'll fail, in everything.
You cannot get another man to fill my boots in the
whole country. And if you were to throw me down
and give the job over into the hands of another gent,
I'd speak one word to him that would be enough."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked, wondering and
angry. "What word?"</p>

<p>"The word 'stop,'" said Bill. "When Cimarron
Bill says 'stop,' you can bet they stop. They know
what it means if they don't. If you don't think so,
count the notches on my guns."</p>

<p>"You mean that you would turn against me?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, madam; I mean that I have no idea
of letting any other gent get my job. I do this piece
of work&mdash;or no one does it. I rather admire the sand
of this Merriwell, though I'd slit his throat, just the
same, for the price. If there was no object in being
against him, I'd surely be for him; and it seems that
you ought to know better than to put Cimarron Bill
in the ranks of the enemy."</p>

<p>"It's a threat!" cried the woman.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not so; it's a business statement, begging your
pardon, madam. I don't propose that any gent shall
jump my claim."</p>

<p>"How can I be sure you'll not play me false? How
can I know you'll not take the money and do nothing?"</p>

<p>"The syndicate paid me in advance, as you know. I
did my best to earn the money. It was not my fault
that I failed. In this case, if you pay the sum I have
named, I swear to you I'll know no rest until I have
succeeded. If I cannot succeed in one way, I will in
another."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I'll capture or kill Frank Merriwell himself."</p>

<p>"If you could do that!" said the woman, with great
eagerness. "He is the great stumbling-block."</p>

<p>"That's right. With him out of the way, taking the
mine would be easy."</p>

<p>"Is there no way this can be done before you try
to seize the mine?"</p>

<p>"He keeps pretty close to it. If he could be caught
by himself. I have had my hands upon him twice,
and he has slipped me both times. Next time he will
not!"</p>

<p>"Next time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An accident will happen to him," assured Bill, with
deadly meaning. "That will be the simplest method."</p>

<p>"You are right!" she said, in a whisper. "If that
could happen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Would you pay the money?"</p>

<p>"I would. Understand, I make no bargain with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
you for such a thing, but that mine must be torn from
him somehow. I have with me some money."</p>

<p>Cimarron Bill understood her well, and he nodded.</p>

<p>"Madam," he said, "give me a little time and I'll
find a way to see to it."</p>

<p>At this moment there was a commotion in the street,
the sound of fighting dogs, shouts of men, and the
clatter of horses' hoofs.</p>

<p>Bill rose quickly and strode to the window, looking
down into the street. A handsome Irish setter had
been attacked by two mongrel dogs, and he was giving
those dogs the surprise of their lives. He had
one by the neck in a moment, and the mongrel was
shaken like a rat. When the setter let go the mongrel
took to his heels, howling with pain and terror. Then
the setter turned on the other dog and a battle that
was fierce enough for a few moments ensued, which
ended again in the complete triumph of the setter.</p>

<p>Two young men had ridden into town behind the
setter, and they had drawn up to witness the result of
the fight. A crowd had quickly gathered, and the triumphant
setter was loudly applauded.</p>

<p>At sight of one of the two horsemen Cimarron Bill
burst forth with an exclamation of excitement.</p>

<p>"Look!" he said, pointing from the open window.
"See&mdash;see that fellow on the dark horse!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Arlington was near the window.</p>

<p>"The one with the small mustache?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the one."</p>

<p>"I see him."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, that's Frank Merriwell!"  said  Bill.</p>

<p>Cimarron Bill was right. Frank Merriwell and
Bart Hodge had ridden into Holbrook, and with them
had come Boxer, the dog. Boxer had been attacked
by the mongrel curs, and he showed his mettle by
quickly putting them to flight.</p>

<p>As Bill gazed down from that window the evil light
in his eyes deepened.</p>

<p>"Remember our bargain!" he said in such a terrible
voice that the woman at his side shuddered.</p>

<p>Then she saw him bring forth a revolver, and,
knowing what he meant to do, she uttered a little
scream and ran back into another part of the room,
unwilling to witness the dark deed.</p>

<p>Quickly kneeling, Bill rested his elbow on the window-ledge
and took aim, meaning to send a bullet
through the heart of the rightful owner of the Queen
Mystery Mine.</p>

<p>The commotion in the street and her mother's cry
had brought June Arlington into that room. June saw
the man with the revolver, and her eyes fell on the
horseman below. She recognized Frank Merriwell, for
all that he was bronzed and changed, and had a small
mustache.</p>

<p>With a sudden scream, the girl flung herself on Bill
and spoiled his aim, so that when the revolver spouted
smoke the bullet flew wide of the mark intended.</p>

<p>Bill uttered a savage snarl, wheeling about.</p>

<p>"You wretch!" panted the girl, who was now pale
as snow. "You murderer!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>The man was dazzled by her beauty. Immediately
he moved back from the window, bowing low.</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, miss," he said. "He sure is an
enemy of mine, and out here we shoots on sight. But
mebbe he is your friend, in which case I lets up and
gives him another show."</p>

<p>In that moment of excitement he had fallen into the
frontier manner of speaking.</p>

<p>She looked at him with unspeakable horror in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" she panted. "You&mdash;you&mdash;murderer!
Mother&mdash;this man&mdash;why is he here?"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Arlington, usually cold as ice and perfectly
self-possessed, had quite lost her nerve. She
sank into a chair, seeming on the verge of fainting,
while she gave Bill a look that, ruffian though he
was, he understood as an appeal to be left alone with
June.</p>

<p>Nor was he loath about getting out of that room.
His pistol had been discharged from the window, and,
though the bullet had found no human target, men
might come in haste to ask unpleasant questions.</p>

<p>"I begs your pardon, madam," he said, hurriedly
picking up his hat. "I thinks I'll call again and finish
this yere bit o' business. Just now I has another matter
to attend to."</p>

<p>Then he hastened out.</p>

<p>June had flown to her mother.</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;tell me, mother, what it means!" she implored.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"My smelling-salts," faintly breathed the woman.
"My heart, June! I&mdash;I'm afraid!"</p>

<p>Now, June knew well that the one great fear of her
mother's life was sudden death from a heart trouble
that came upon her at times, and so the girl hastened
to bring out the bottle of salts and hold it beneath the
pale lady's nose till she was somewhat recovered,
though still resting limp on her chair and breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>"What does it mean, mother?" asked the girl again.
"I do not understand these strange things. I do not
understand why such a wicked-looking man should
be here in this room and about to shoot down in cold
blood a young man in the street. He would have
shot him from this very window had not I spoiled his
aim."</p>

<p>Mrs. Arlington turned her eyes toward her daughter's
face, but looked away quickly, still trembling.</p>

<p>"Did you know him at whom the man was about to
shoot?" she weakly asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew him, or I am much mistaken. It was
Frank Merriwell. I saw him at the hotel in Fardale
the day I returned to him those papers. You recollect,
mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember it all too well, and it was the
giving back to him of those papers that has made no
end of trouble for us all. But for that foolish act of
yours, June, he would not still be holding the mines
that are rightfully the property of the C. M. A. of A."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"If those mines do not belong to him, how is it that
he can hold them?"</p>

<p>"He has possession, and he holds it with armed
men."</p>

<p>"But the law&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The law is slow, and, without those papers, it is not
very sure. It is your folly, girl," declared the woman
reproachfully, "that has made no end of trouble. It
is your folly that brought Frank Merriwell near to
his end a few moments ago, though you it was who
saved him then."</p>

<p>"Mother, you speak in riddles! How can that be?
I gave him back what was his. And have you forgotten
that it was his brother, Dick, who kept you from
slipping beneath the car-wheels, where you must have
been maimed or killed?"</p>

<p>At this Mrs. Arlington sat up, and something like
anger took from her her great pallor.</p>

<p>"No," said she, "nor have I forgotten that it was
Dick Merriwell who brought upon my son all his
trouble at Fardale! Dick Merriwell has been his
blight there! Dick Merriwell is his enemy. He has
tried to set himself over my boy, and no one shall do
that!"</p>

<p>June knew how useless it was to talk of this matter
with her mother, who refused to listen to reason,
and so she did not try to press it further; but she
again asked who was the man who had tried to shoot
from the window.</p>

<p>"He was a miner," said Mrs. Arlington.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what business had he here in this room?"</p>

<p>"That is nothing to you, girl. Forget that you saw
him here."</p>

<p>"A thing easier said than done, mother. I saw his
face and his eyes, and I know he is a wicked man and
one to be greatly feared. Why should you have dealings
with such a wretch?"</p>

<p>"You ask too many needless questions, June. Look
out and tell me if you still see anything of&mdash;of&mdash;Frank
Merriwell."</p>

<p>But when June looked from the window Frank Merriwell
was not to be seen on the street, which had again
resumed its usual aspect.</p>

<p>"I must have a spell of quiet to restore my nerves,
June," said Mrs. Arlington, when the girl had told
her. "Leave me. Call Jackson. I think I will lie
down."</p>

<p>So the colored maid was called, and June lingered to
make sure there was nothing she could do for her
mother, who coldly bade her go.</p>

<p>In her own room June found herself filled with
tempestuous thoughts and vain speculations. She was
bewildered by it all, and there was much that she
could not understand, for her mother had told her little
or nothing of what had brought them to that Arizona
town. She was wise enough to know full well
that the lady had not come there in search of health,
and surely it could not be pleasure she expected in
such a place, which left but one thing to suppose&mdash;it
was business. But what sort of business could she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
have there? and why should she meet and do business
with a murderous wretch like the man who had tried
to shoot Frank Merriwell from the open window?</p>

<p>Knowing there was little danger of interruption,
June found pen, ink, and paper and sat herself down
to write a letter. She thought at first that she would
make it very brief, and she found it exceedingly hard
to begin; but when she had begun it, it ran on and on
until she had written many pages. Sometimes she
laughed over it, and sometimes she blushed; once her
chin quivered and tears seemed to fill her splendid eyes.
When it was all finished she read it over, her cheeks
glowing, and at the end she kissed the paper, at which
the blush swept down to her very neck, and in great
confusion she folded it all hastily and put it into an
envelope, which she hurriedly sealed. Although she
was not aware of it, she had spent nearly two hours
over the letter. On the envelope she wrote a name
and address, and then, finding her hat, she slipped out
to mail it.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<h3>A SENSATION IN TOWN.</h3>


<p>Frank's little "scout," as he called it, on which expedition
he had driven the redskins from the wounded
miner, had convinced him that Cimarron Bill and his
gang had withdrawn from the vicinity of the Queen
Mystery Mine.</p>

<p>So it came about that Merry and Bart Hodge started
for Holbrook, bringing with them the gold Frank had
found in the saddle-bags and belt of the dead miner.</p>

<p>Boxer would not be left behind. Since the death of
his former master the dog kept close to Frank, for
whom he seemed to have formed an affection quite as
deep as that he had entertained for Benson Clark.</p>

<p>Frank and Bart came, dust covered and wearied,
into Holbrook.</p>

<p>Boxer's engagement with the mongrel curs, who set
upon him, was an incident to enliven their advent in
town, and it demonstrated the mettle of the setter.</p>

<p>The shot that came from the window of the hotel
was somewhat surprising; but, as the bullet failed to
pass anywhere near either Bart or Merry, they did not
fancy it was intended for them. Still Frank dropped
a hand toward the pistol swinging at his hip, thinking
the lead might be intended for Boxer.</p>

<p>A puff of smoke was dissolving before the open window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
but Cimarron Bill had vanished, nor did he again
appear there. Neither Frank nor Bart had seen him.</p>

<p>So they were not greatly alarmed, and they laughed
over the manner in which Boxer had put his assailants
to flight, merriment which was joined in by many of
the spectators who had gathered to witness the fight.</p>

<p>"Good boy, Boxer!" said Merry. "You did that
up slickly."</p>

<p>At which the setter turned toward Frank and
showed his teeth in a grin, and something followed
that caused several of the bystanders to gasp and stagger
or stand dazed and astounded.</p>

<p>When Frank and Bart rode on two or three of those
men hurried into Schlitzenheimer's saloon, where one
of them banged the bar with his clenched fist, and
shouted:</p>

<p>"By thunder! that's the first time I ever heard a dog
talk! Was I dreaming?"</p>

<p>"None whatever, pard!" declared another, mopping
sweat from his face. "I heard it plain enough. For
the love of goodness, Fritz, give me a snifter of tanglefoot!
I need something to brace my nerves after
that!"</p>

<p>"Vot id vos you peen sayin'?" asked the fat Dutchman
behind the bar. "Vot vos dot voolishness apoudt
der talkings uf a tog?"</p>

<p>"No foolishness," declared the sweating individual,
as whisky and glasses were placed on the bar. "I'll
swear to it. The dog that came in with those young
gents an' whipped two other dogs in short order sartin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
made an observation in good, clean United States, or
I'm the biggest liar on two legs."</p>

<p>"Say, Benchy!" said the Dutchman scornfully, "I
pelief you vos readiness to haf anoder attack py dose
delerium triangles, ain'd id! Uf you vill undertook
my advice, you vill off svear alretty soon und safe
yourseluf from der snakes some droubles."</p>

<p>"This is my first drink to-day," asserted Benchy, as
he poured with shaking hand; "and I'd not take this
if I didn't need it a whole lot to steady my nerves arter
hearin' a dog talk."</p>

<p>"It's on the level, Fritz," assured the man who had
banged the bar with his fist. "I heard it myself. The
young fellow with the mustache says to the dog arter
the dog had licked t'other dogs, says he, 'Good boy,
Boxer; you done that up slick.' Then the dog turns
about and grins up at him and winks, and he opens his
mouth, and I hope I may be struck dead where I
stand this minute if he didn't answer and say, 'Oh,
that was no trick at all, Frank; those low-bred curs
haven't any sand.' I heard it, Fritz, and I'll swear
to it with my last breath!"</p>

<p>"You vos craziness!" said the Dutchman. "Oh, you
vos drying some jokes on me to play alretty."</p>

<p>But now several of the others asserted that they
also had heard the dog speak, and that the animal had
uttered the very words quoted by the man called
Spikes.</p>

<p>"Id peen a put-up jobs!" shouted Schlitzenheimer
angrily. "Uf vor a greadt vool you tookit me, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
vos not so much uf a jackass as I look to peen! Id
vos nod bossible a tog vor to speech, und I vill bate
zwi t'ousan' tollar it on!"</p>

<p>"But I heard him!" declared Benchy.</p>

<p>"I'm another!" averred Spikes.</p>

<p>"We all heard him!" cried the others at the bar.</p>

<p>"You got vrom my blace uf pusiness out britty
queek!" ordered the Dutchman, in a great rage. "I
vill not had so many plame liars aroundt! Und dond
you back come some more alretty undil you vos
readiness apology to make vor me drying to vool!"</p>

<p>"Look here, Fritz," said Benchy, leaning on the
bar, "I'll bet you ten dollars coin of the realm that the
dog can talk! If I had been alone in hearing the
beast, I might have thought myself fooled; but all
these other gents heard him, and so there is no mistake.
Do you take me?"</p>

<p>"Den tollars haf nod seen you in a month," declared
Schlitzenheimer disdainfully. "Howeffer, uf you
prings pack by you dot tog und he vill speech my
saloon in, I vill gif you den tollars my own moneys
out uf, and all der drink you can a whole veek vor.
Now, you tookit my advice und shut upness or make
goot britty queek."</p>

<p>"I'll do it!" cried Benchy, and he hastened forth.</p>

<p>Frank and Bart had proceeded directly to the bank,
where their dust was weighed and taken on deposit.
This done, they left and sought a square meal in the
very hotel where Mrs. Arlington and June were stopping.
Fortunately the presence of his guests, who paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
extravagantly well, had caused the proprietor to have
on hand an unusual stock of cooked food, and he was
able to see that the young men from the mines were
provided for in a manner that surprised and pleased
them not a little.</p>

<p>Although he took good care to keep out of sight,
Cimarron Bill knew Frank Merriwell was in the hotel.
At the bar of the place Bill found a rough, bewhiskered
fellow, whom he drew aside.</p>

<p>"Bob," said Bill, in a whisper, "are you ready to
tackle a tough proposition?"</p>

<p>"For the needful, Bill," was the quiet answer of the
man, who, in spite of his rough appearance, was known
by his mild manner of speech as Gentle Bob. "What
is it?"</p>

<p>"You know the young tenderfoot gent what I have
been stacking up against&mdash;the one what I spoke to you
about?"</p>

<p>"I reckon."</p>

<p>"Well, he is now eatin' in the dinin'-room."</p>

<p>"Sho!" said Bob, in placid surprise.</p>

<p>"Fact," assured Bill. "Him an' one of his pards is
thar. They came inter town together a short time
ago. Now, I could pick a quarrel with them, and I
allows I could shoot 'em both; but it would be knowed
agin' me that I had been tryin' to jump their claim,
which sartin' would rouse feelin's. In your case, as
you were nohow consarned in the raid on the mine,
it would be different, an' I 'lows you might find a way
o' doin' the job easy an' slick. You kin plead self-defense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
an' I  promise you there will be plenty o'
money to defend ye."</p>

<p>"It's the money fer the job I'm a-thinkin' of first,
Bill," said Bob.</p>

<p>"A good clean thousan' dollars if you shoots the
young gent with the mustache," whispered Bill.</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?" asked Bob, looking at him hard.
"Where does it come from?"</p>

<p>"That I allow is none of your business. You has
my word that you gets it. And I opine the word o'
Cimarron Bill is knowed to be good."</p>

<p>"As his bond," said Gentle Bob, taking out a brace
of pistols and looking them over. "I takes the job,
Bill; and there sartin will be a funeral in these parts
to-morrer."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<h3>BOXER CREATES A STIR.</h3>


<p>When Frank and Bart came out of the hotel, with
Boxer at their heels, they found a group of men on the
steps engaged in earnest discussion. Immediately, on
sight of the two young men and the dog, the babel of
voices fell to a hush and the men all squared about and
stared. But Merry immediately noticed that it was
not at Bart or himself that they were staring, but at
Boxer. The dog seemed to observe this, likewise, for
he stopped short, with one paw uplifted, surveyed the
men, and Frank, who was a clever ventriloquist, made
the animal apparently say:</p>

<p>"Say, Frank, what do you suppose the ginnies are
gawking at?"</p>

<p>"Mother av Moses!" cried an Irishman in the group.
"Oi swear be all the saints the baste did spake!"</p>

<p>"Yah! yah!" chattered a pig-tailed Chinaman by the
name of Sing Lee, who ran a laundry in town. "Dogee
talkee allee samee likee Chinyman."</p>

<p>"Go on, you rat-eater!" contemptuously exclaimed
the dog. "If I couldn't talk better than you I'd go
drown myself!"</p>

<p>Needless to say this brought the excitement of the
crowd to a high pitch.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>Benchy and Spikes were on hand, and now the former
appealed to Frank.</p>

<p>"Is that your dog?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I lay claim to him," smiled Merry.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he&mdash;can he talk?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what better evidence do you want than your
own ears?"</p>

<p>"That's enough; but Schlitzenheimer called me
names and said I was trying to put up a joke on him
because I told him I heard the dog talk."</p>

<p>"Who's Schlitzenheimer?"</p>

<p>"He runs the saloon down the street right in front
of which your dog whipped those other dogs what
jumped on him. He's a black-headed Dutchman.
Come on down and show him the dog."</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried others.</p>

<p>Merry didn't mind the lark, but he now turned to
the dog, with a very serious expression on his face,
saying:</p>

<p>"How about it, Boxer? I believe you told me you
hold an antipathy against Dutchmen. Will you go
down to Schlitzenheimer's with me?"</p>

<p>The dog seemed to hesitate, and then he answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care; go ahead. I'm not stuck on
Dutchmen, but I'll teach this one a lesson."</p>

<p>"All right," said Merry. "Come on."</p>

<p>Benchy triumphantly led the way, being followed
by Frank and Bart and the dog, with the crowd at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
heels of them. The Irishman was protesting his wonderment,
while the Chinaman chattered excitedly.</p>

<p>Within the hotel a man had been watching and listening.
He was a bewhiskered ruffian, and he strode
forth and followed the crowd to the Dutchman's saloon.
Cimarron Bill watched his tool depart, smiling
darkly and muttering to himself:</p>

<p>"Good-by, Bob! You're going up against a hard
proposition in Frank Merriwell, and it's not likely
you'll call to collect that little sum of money from me.
All the same, I hope you get in a shot, for you shoot
straight, and you may make a round sum for my
pocket, as I'll compel the old lady to lay down the cash.
I'll be able to scare her into it by threatening to tell
the whole story and bring her into the game as an accomplice.
That will yank her around to her feet in
short order, I opine."</p>

<p>For all of Bill's reputation as a "killer," he was
willing to let this piece of work over to the attention
of another.</p>

<p>So Gentle Bob followed Merriwell, an evil purpose
in his black heart, nor knew that his employer believed
and half-hoped he might be going to his own end.</p>

<p>Benchy burst into the saloon, uttering a cry of triumph.</p>

<p>"Here comes the dog!" he said. "Now I have you,
you old duffer! You'll find out he can talk."</p>

<p>Schlitzenheimer stared at the door, through which
the crowd followed Frank, and Bart, and the dog.</p>

<p>"Vos dot der tog?" he said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you take me for a monkey, you lobster-faced
frankfurter?" saucily demanded the dog.</p>

<p>"Hey?" squawked the saloon-keeper, turning purple.
"Vot id vos? Dit I hear correctness?"</p>

<p>"Be careful, Boxer," said Frank reprovingly.
"Don't be so free with your lip. You may offend the
gentleman."</p>

<p>"Gentleman!" exclaimed the setter, in a tone of profound
contempt. "Do you call that sourkraut-barrel a
gentleman? I'm surprised at you, Frank!"</p>

<p>At this there was a burst of laughter, and Schlitzenheimer
turned as red as he had been pale a moment
before.</p>

<p>"Vot vor did dot tog vanted to insult me?" he exclaimed
indignantly. "I dit not someding to him do!"</p>

<p>"Boxer, I'm surprised!" cried Frank. "You will
get me into trouble with your careless language. I
insist that you apologize immediately to the gentleman.
I insist, sir!"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said the dog; "if you insist, I'll
apologize. I was joking, anyway."</p>

<p>"And I add my own apology, Mr. Schlitzenheimer,"
said Merry. "I hope this will be sufficient?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yah, dot peen all righdt," said the Dutchman
at once. "But py dunder! der tickens id does peat to
heard a tog dalking!"</p>

<p>"It's a good one on you, Fritz!" cried Benchy
triumphantly. "Remember your agreement! You're
stuck!"</p>

<p>"Vale, I will stood py dot agreements," said the saloon-keeper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
rather reluctantly, "efen if in pusiness id
does preak me up. Und I vill sdant treat der crowdt
vor. Sdep up, eferpody, und your trink name."</p>

<p>"That's the talk!" cried the dog. "You're not such
a bad fellow, Schlitzy."</p>

<p>Schlitzenheimer leaned on the bar with both hands
and looked over at Boxer.</p>

<p>"Vot will you haf yourseluf?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said the setter; "I'm on the water-wagon.
Go ahead, gentlemen, and don't mind me."</p>

<p>So they lined up in front of the bar, expressing their
amazement over the accomplishment of the dog and
burdening Merriwell with questions, all of which
Frank cheerfully answered or skilfully evaded.</p>

<p>Boxer had been lifted and placed on one end of the
bar, where he immediately sat, surveying the line of
men with his clear, intelligent eyes.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mike!" he called to the Irishman. "When
did you leave the Old Dart?"</p>

<p>"It's goin' on three year now," answered the son of
the Old Sod civilly; "and me name's not Moike&mdash;it's
Pat."</p>

<p>The dog seemed to wink shrewdly.</p>

<p>"It's all the same," he declared; "Mike or Pat makes
no difference, as long as your last name is Murphy."</p>

<p>"But me last name's not Murphy at all, at all&mdash;it's
O'Grady, av yez plaze."</p>

<p>"Thanks," snickered the dog. "I have it down pat
now. It's a way I have of finding out a man's name
when no one takes the trouble to introduce him. Drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
hearty, Pat; the whisky'll add to the beautiful tint
of your nose."</p>

<p>"Begorra! it's a divvil the crayther is!" muttered
Pat, nudging his nearest neighbor.</p>

<p>"Ah, there, Chink!" called the setter, seeming to get
his eye on the Chinaman, who was staring open-mouthed.
"How's the washee-washee business?"</p>

<p>"Oh, velly good, velly good!" answered the Celestial
hurriedly, backing off a little, his face yellowish
white.</p>

<p>"Vele," said Schlitzenheimer, holding up a glass of
beer; "here vos goot health to der smardest tog vot
effer vos."</p>

<p>"Drink hearty," said Boxer; and, with the exception
of Frank and Bart, all swallowed their drinks.
Not wishing anything to drink, and still desiring to
join in so that the saloon-keeper might not be offended,
Frank and Bart had taken cigars, which they slipped
into their pockets.</p>

<p>"Dot tog peen der vonder der vorld uf," said Schlitzenheimer,
gazing admiringly at Boxer. "Vot vill you
soldt him vor?"</p>

<p>"There's not enough money in Arizona to buy him
from me," answered Frank at once.</p>

<p>"You know a good thing when you see it," chuckled
the dog.</p>

<p>"Vos there anything exception talk vot he can do?"
asked Fritz.</p>

<p>"Lots of things," answered Merry. "He can play
cards."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Beenuckle?" asked the Dutchman.</p>

<p>"You bet! He's a dabster at pinocle."</p>

<p>"Easy, Merry!" cautioned the setter, in a whisper.
"If you want to skin the old bologna-sausage out of
his shekels, don't puff me up. I can't beat him at his
own game."</p>

<p>"Vale, I pet den tollars you can't dot do!" cried
Schlitzenheimer. "I nefer vould acknowledgment dot
a tog could peat me!"</p>

<p>Frank sternly turned on Boxer.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by getting me into such a
scrape?" he demanded, shaking his finger at the setter.
"You know I never gamble, and I will not bet
on a game of cards. If you make any more such
foolish talk, I'll not let you play at all."</p>

<p>The dog hung his head and looked quite ashamed.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon," he whined softly. "I was joking
again!"</p>

<p>"I'll blay der fun uf him vor," said Schlitzenheimer.
"Id vill peen a creat jokes to said I had a came uf beenuckle
blayed mit a tog. Come on."</p>

<p>He hurried out from behind the bar.</p>

<p>"Begorra! Oi'd loike to take a hand in this!" cried
Pat O'Grady, as a square table was drawn out and
the cards produced. "It's a shlick game av peenockle
Oi play."</p>

<p>"But three-handed&mdash;&mdash;" said Frank.</p>

<p>"Be afther makin' the fourth yesilf."</p>

<p>"I have to hold the cards for Boxer, he having no
hands of his own," explained Merry.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>Then it was that Gentle Bob stepped forward, saying,
in a very quiet voice and polite manner, that he
would be pleased to enter the game.</p>

<p>Now, with the exception of Frank and Bart, all
knew that Bob was a very bad man to offend, and so
they were willing enough that he should play, and it
was soon arranged.</p>

<p>Frank was keen enough to see in what manner the
ruffianly looking fellow with the quiet voice was regarded,
and, as he was not in Holbrook in search of
a quarrel, he raised no dissent. However, he gave
Hodge a look that Bart understood, and the silent
youth nodded. From that moment Bart watched Gentle
Bob closely.</p>

<p>The crowd drew about the table, eager to witness a
game of cards in which a dog took part.</p>

<p>Merry sat on a short bench, with Boxer at his side.
The cards were cut, and the deal fell to Schlitzenheimer.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Dutchy," advised Boxer. "We're
watching you, and you'd better not try any slick
tricks."</p>

<p>"Eferything on der lefel shall pe," assured the saloon-keeper,
pulling at his long pipe.</p>

<p>O'Grady was likewise smoking, and his pipe contrasted
ludicrously with that of Schlitzenheimer.</p>

<p>When the cards were dealt, it fell the dog's turn to
meld first. Frank spread out the cards and held them
in front of Boxer's nose.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will meld one hundred aces," said the dog. "Put
'em down, Frank."</p>

<p>Merry did so.</p>

<p>"Sixty queens," called Boxer, and Merry spread
them out.</p>

<p>"Lally ka lolly loka!" chattered Sing Lee, or something
like that; whereupon Boxer seemed to fix the
Chinaman with a scornful stare, and observed:</p>

<p>"You ought to take something for that. It must
be painful."</p>

<p>"Gleatee Sklot!" gasped the Celestial. "Dogee hab
a debbil!" And he backed away.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Boxer. "I like you a long
distance off, the longer the distance the better I like
you."</p>

<p>"Pay attention to the game," said Frank. "Are you
going to meld anything else?"</p>

<p>"Forty trumps, twenty spades, and twenty hearts,"
said Boxer.</p>

<p>"Dunder!" muttered Schlitzenheimer, and his hands
trembled so that he dropped some of the cards.</p>

<p>"Get a basket," snickered the dog; and the crowd
laughed loudly at the saloon-keeper's expense.</p>

<p>When all the melding was finished they prepared to
play.</p>

<p>"I'll lead the ace of trumps," said Boxer.</p>

<p>Frank ran the cards over.</p>

<p>"It's here," he said. "But I didn't see it."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with your eyes?" snapped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
dog. "Didn't I meld one hundred aces? You ought
to learn something about this game!"</p>

<p>"I seldom play cards," said Merry apologetically.</p>

<p>"Well, you want to keep your eyes open!" exclaimed
Boxer sharply. "These chaps may try to skin us."</p>

<p>At this Gentle Bob looked up and said:</p>

<p>"I do not mind a little faking none whatever, but I
sure objects to being called a skin, either by a dog
or his master, so I opine it will be best for somebody
to apologize."</p>

<p>And, as he made this remark, he suddenly whipped
forth a pistol, with which he covered both Frank and
the dog, but held the weapon more in Merry's direction.</p>

<p>Cimarron Bill's tool had found the opportunity he
sought, and he meant to make the most of it.</p>

<p>Merry saw in the fellow's eyes the full extent of
his evil purpose.</p>

<p>"If the apology is not forthcoming instanter," murmured
the ruffian, "I shall puncture the wonderful
talking dog with a bullet!"</p>

<p>Now, it seemed that Bob had Frank at a great disadvantage,
but at this point Bart Hodge shoved the
muzzle of a pistol against the fellow's ear and harshly
commanded:</p>

<p>"Put up that gun&mdash;instanter! If you don't I'll blow
the whole top of your head off!"</p>

<p>But Bart had made a miscalculation, for Gentle Bob
had not come alone to the saloon, having noted well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
that Frank Merriwell had a friend. He had picked up
a chap of his own sort, and now this fellow had a
gun at Bart's head.</p>

<p>"You're the one who'll lose the ruff o' his head!"
he said. "You put up your gun!"</p>

<p>Gentle Bob still sat pistol in hand, but Boxer had
taken advantage of an opportunity to drop down from
the bench to the floor.</p>

<p>Of a sudden there came a wild yell from Bob, who
kicked out with his feet and flung himself backward,
his pistol being discharged straight up at the ceiling.</p>

<p>Boxer had seized him by the leg beneath the table.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a fearful uproar in the saloon.
The action of the dog had disconcerted the plans of
every one. Hodge ducked and whirled, catching the
ruffian at his back a fearful blow on the solar plexus
that drove him slam against the bar, and he went down
and "out."</p>

<p>Merry went across the table in a leap at Gentle Bob,
from whom he tore the revolver that the fellow was
trying to use on Boxer.</p>

<p>"Let up, boy," said Frank to the dog. "I'll attend
to his case."</p>

<p>Boxer seemed reluctant to let go, but he did so at
the second command.</p>

<p>Merriwell pinned Bob down and deftly disarmed
him, removing every weapon, which he passed over to
Schlitzenheimer.</p>

<p>"Take care of these tools, sir," he said, "until I
leave town. It will save this fellow's life&mdash;perhaps."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>"Und dot vill peen a pity!" muttered the saloon-keeper,
who had no love for the ruffian, but held him
in great awe.</p>

<p>Having disarmed Bob, Merry rose and commanded
him to get up. The fellow rose immediately and
sprang at Frank, trying to strike him.</p>

<p>Boxer would have mingled in, but Bart held him in
check, saying:</p>

<p>"Keep out of it. Frank can attend to that case
now without any of your aid."</p>

<p>Hodge was not mistaken, as Merriwell quickly demonstrated.
He avoided the blows of the ruffian and
quickly knocked him down. Bob rose, only to be
struck in the eye and sent to the floor again. Four
times this happened, and then Merry picked the wretch
up, carried him bodily to the door, and kicked him
into the street, observing:</p>

<p>"If you come back here or bother me again, I'll
send you to the hospital for a month!"</p>

<p>And the dog barked with great satisfaction.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<h3>BOXER TO THE RESCUE.</h3>


<p>The second ruffian was ejected, and Frank and the
talking dog were regarded with unbounded admiration
by every one present.</p>

<p>"I neffer haf seen Shentle Pob done upness pefore,"
remarked Schlitzenheimer. "He vos a pad man."</p>

<p>"You bettee!" put in Sing Lee, who crept forth from
behind a barrel, where he had taken refuge during the
encounter. "Him velly bad. Him shootee, stabbee,
killee."</p>

<p>"An' so he will," nodded Pat O'Grady, seeming
quite concerned. "It's me opinion he wur lookin' fer
throuble whin he came here."</p>

<p>"Well, he found it," smiled Merry.</p>

<p>"That's what!" said Boxer, wagging his tail and
looking up at Frank knowingly. "But he tasted disagreeable.
You don't suppose it will make me sick, do
you?"</p>

<p>Frank stooped and patted the dog's head.</p>

<p>"I hope not," he laughed. "You got hold of his
leg just in time, old boy."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't dally when I saw him throw his gun
out," said Boxer, winking rapidly with both eyes. "I
allowed he was going to begin shooting directly."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Uf you vould tookit my device," said Schlitzenheimer,
"you couldt out uf dis town get a hurriness
indo."</p>

<p>"Thot's roight," nodded O'Grady. "It's moighty
dangerous to remain after this, Oi know."</p>

<p>"Pob vill got vor heemseluf another gun, und he
vill look vor you on der sdreet," declared the saloon-keeper.</p>

<p>"Well, he may find us, eh, Boxer?" smiled Frank.</p>

<p>"Sure thing," said the dog. "And I reckon you can
shoot as quick and as straight as he can."</p>

<p>Schlitzenheimer shook his head and averred that
Bob was the greatest pistol-shot known in those parts,
which, however, did not seem to alarm Frank Merriwell
in the least.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a scream from the street, the
voice being that of a girl, and the sound indicating that
she was in great fear and distress.</p>

<p>Frank sprang to the open door, Boxer barking at his
heels, and Hodge was not slow in following.</p>

<p>The cry had issued from the lips of June Arlington,
who was then on her way to the post-office to mail
the letter she had written, not wishing her mother to
see it.</p>

<p>June had arrived in the vicinity of the saloon as
Gentle Bob was turning away. She noted that the
man's face was cut and bruised and one eye was swollen.
His appearance led her to look at him with something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
like sympathy, when, of a sudden, he turned on
her, smiling evilly, and seized her arm.</p>

<p>"Derned ef you ain't a right peert gal!" said the
fellow insolently. "Gimme a kiss, sweetness."</p>

<p>Then June screamed and tried to break away, striking
at him with her clenched fist. She was frightened
and angry.</p>

<p>"Stop yer squarmin'!" snarled the fellow, who had
thought to kiss her quickly before she could make
much resistance, and then hasten along, it being his
intention to boast of what he had done.</p>

<p>But June would not stop. She saw a tall, athletic
young man come bounding through an open doorway
into the street, followed closely by a dog and another
young man. Her eyes recognized the one in advance,
and she cried out:</p>

<p>"Mr. Merriwell, help&mdash;help, quick!"</p>

<p>With a growl of rage, Gentle Bob released her and
turned. As he did so, the dog, terrible in his fury,
shot past Frank, and made a great spring through the
air straight at Bob's throat.</p>

<p>Bob threw up his arm, and the teeth of the dog
fastened on it. The force of the creature's leap hurled
the ruffian backward.</p>

<p>The man went down in the dust, and Boxer was at
him with all the fury of a mad animal. He would
have torn the wretch to pieces right before their eyes,
but Frank fearlessly grasped the dog and pulled him
away, at the same time crying commandingly to him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Keep him off!" palpitated Bob, now filled with a
great terror for the fierce animal. "Don't let him
touch me ag'in! He's near bit me to pieces now!"</p>

<p>"You got just what you deserved, and no more, you
miserable creature!" said Frank indignantly.</p>

<p>Then he turned and asked June what Bob had been
doing.</p>

<p>"Oh, he grasped me, and he tried to kiss me!"</p>

<p>"Did he!" grated Merry, very white. "Then I
should have let Boxer finish him!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" gasped June.</p>

<p>"No, no!" exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>"On your knees!" cried Frank, in ringing tones&mdash;"on
your knees and apologize to the young lady! If
you don't do it, so help me, I'll let Boxer get at you
again!"</p>

<p>Bob did not hesitate. Ruffian and desperado though
he was reputed to be, he cast himself on his knees before
June and humbly begged her pardon, all the
while watching Boxer, who glared back at him and
licked his chops.</p>

<p>"Get up and go, you pitiful coward!" said Frank.
"Keep out of my sight while I'm in town, and be
careful not to try any dirty tricks. If you hurt me,
Boxer will eat you up; if you hurt Boxer, I'll have
your life! Go!"</p>

<p>The wretch lost not a moment in getting away.</p>

<p>Frank stooped and picked up the letter June had
dropped. He was restoring it to her when his eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
caught the address upon it, and he stared in astonishment.</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Richard Merriwell</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fardale."</p></blockquote>

<p>That was the name and address he read. Then he
looked closely at June and recognized her.</p>

<p>"Miss Arlington?" he exclaimed, his hat in his hand;
"is it possible?"</p>

<p>The color was coming back into her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Mr. Merriwell," she said, "let me thank you for
coming so quickly to my assistance."</p>

<p>"It was Boxer who got there first. But I'm amazed
to see you here&mdash;here in Arizona."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it."</p>

<p>"What brings you to this place?"</p>

<p>"I came with my mother."</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;your mother?" he said, still further astonished.
"And your father&mdash;he is here, also?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"He is coming?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I believe not."</p>

<p>Merry had thought at once that there might be a
very good reason why D. Roscoe Arlington should
come to Holbrook to learn just how well the hired
ruffians of the syndicate had performed their tasks,
but the presence there of Mrs. Arlington and June,
without D. Roscoe, rather bewildered him.</p>

<p>June looked back toward the hotel windows, thinking
it must be that her mother had heard her cry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
would be looking forth; but was relieved to see nothing
of the lady.</p>

<p>"You were on your way to mail this letter?" said
Frank, divining her destination.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"May I accompany you, to make sure you are not
molested further?"</p>

<p>She accepted his escort. Bart had lingered near,
and Frank presented him.</p>

<p>"An old school and college chum, Miss Arlington,"
he said, "and one of my closest friends."</p>

<p>Bart lifted his hat and bowed, smiling a bit on the
pretty girl. In his way, which was dark and silent,
he was almost every bit as handsome as Frank himself,
and it is no cause of wonderment that June could
not wholly repress the flash of admiration that came
into her splendid eyes.</p>

<p>On his part, Bart was quite smitten with her, and
he stood watching Frank walk away at her side, Boxer
following, smiling without envy, yet thinking his
friend fortunate to have the company of such a charming
girl for even a brief time in that part of the
country.</p>

<p>Frank found himself somewhat embarrassed, not a
little to his surprise, as he walked down the street with
June. The girl was the daughter of the man who was
doing his best to bring upon Merriwell complete ruin&mdash;or
seemed to be doing his best to that end, for
Frank could not know that all his trouble at the Queen
Mystery had not risen directly from D. Roscoe Arlington.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Much less did he suspect that any great part of
it came without Mr. Arlington's knowledge and
through the vengeful malice of Mrs. Arlington.</p>

<p>It was not agreeable to speak of this matter with
June, and still in his heart Merry was more than eager
to know what had brought the girl to Holbrook. He
had not forgotten that it was the hand of June that
had restored to him the precious papers relating to
the mines when those papers had been stolen from
him in Fardale, a service for which he remained
grateful.</p>

<p>Further than this, Frank had learned that Dick had
a deep interest in June&mdash;so deep, indeed, that the boy
himself did not quite suspect its measure. Merry had
been able to read his brother, and his good sense told
him beyond question that never would Dick hold his
hand from the person of his most persistent enemy
simply because that enemy's sister thus entreated him,
unless there was back of it all a feeling of affection for
the sister that was of no small magnitude.</p>

<p>That June cared something for Dick, Merry more
than half-suspected, and the sight of the name on the
letter she now carried in her hand seemed very good
evidence that this was not false fancy on his part, for
did she not care for the lad far away in Fardale,
then why should she write to him?</p>

<p>It was June herself who relieved Frank's embarrassment
by earnestly turning to him and beginning
speech.</p>

<p>"Mr. Merriwell," she said, with such a sober face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
that he was greatly surprised, "I have wanted to see
you since you came into town."</p>

<p>"Then you knew I had entered town?"</p>

<p>"I saw you; and I have wanted to speak with you
to warn you."</p>

<p>"To warn me?" said Frank. "Of what?"</p>

<p>"Of your great danger, for you are in danger here.
You have in this town a man who would kill you."</p>

<p>"I think we lately parted from such a man," smiled
Merry.</p>

<p>"But he is not the one."</p>

<p>"Is there another?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I saw him! Perhaps I saved your life."</p>

<p>At this Frank gave a great start of surprise and
asked her how that could be, upon which she told him
how Cimarron Bill had shot at him from the window,
and how she had spoiled the aim of the would-be murderer.
She held back the fact that the man had fired
from one of the windows of her mother's rooms, and
that her mother had shortly before been in consultation
with him. Still Frank was keen enough to see that
she was hiding something, and he had the good discernment
to come close to guessing the truth.</p>

<p>"Miss Arlington," he said, "it seems that I owe you
my life. I heard the shot, but I could not be sure
it was fired at me. If I mistake not, the man who fired
it has a deadly aim, and I could not have escaped
but for your quickness in spoiling his sight. I owe you
a great deal more than I can ever repay."</p>

<p>June knew something of the truth, and she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
aware that her father was concerned in a movement
the accomplishment of which meant ruin to both Frank
and Dick; therefore this acknowledgment by Frank of
his indebtedness to her caused her to flush with shame.</p>

<p>"It is I who owe you a great deal!" she exclaimed.
"See what you have just done&mdash;saved me from a ruffian!
But your brother&mdash;Dick&mdash;he did more. He
saved me once from the fangs of furious dogs, at another
time from being killed in a runaway, and that
is not all. It is I who owe you much more than I can
ever repay. My brother"&mdash;she choked a little&mdash;"my
brother is Dick's enemy, yet, for a promise to me, Dick
has been easy with him and has not forced him in disgrace
from Fardale. Oh, Mr. Merriwell!" she suddenly
exclaimed, feeling her utter inability to express
herself, "it seems to me that never before was a girl
placed in such a position as I find myself in! What
can I do?"</p>

<p>"You can do nothing, Miss June," he said gently.
"You are not to blame for anything that may happen,
and I shall not forget that. I am very sorry for you,
as I fancy you must be far from comfortable."</p>

<p>At this her pride returned, and she straightened,
thinking she could not acknowledge to him that her
people were in the wrong.</p>

<p>"You know there is always two sides to any question,"
she said, "and there may be as much of right on
one side as the other. I presume my father has every
reason to think himself right."</p>

<p>Now, June knew that it was her mother who hated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Dick and Frank with undying intensity, while her
father cared very little about either of the Merriwells,
save that he had been led to wonder immoderately at
the success of Frank in fighting the syndicate; but she
wished to avoid the shame of confessing that her
mother had such a vengeful nature and could enter
with vindictiveness into an affair that might well be
left to men.</p>

<p>Frank had no desire to hurt her feelings. He understood
her pride and sensitiveness, and he said:</p>

<p>"It is very likely you are correct about that. At
any rate, we will not argue it. It is no matter for us
to speak of, as what we might say would not change
the situation in the least. Still, if I should become satisfied
that your father had the right in this thing, even
though it stripped me of my last dollar and made me
a beggar, I would surrender to him immediately."</p>

<p>She did not doubt him then, and she saw that the
character of Frank Merriwell was one to be admired,
his one concern being for perfect and complete justice,
even though by justice he might be the sufferer. Inwardly
she was struck with the conviction that her
father seldom made inquiry into the justice of any
project he wished to carry through, his one concern
being to accomplish his ends by any method whatever,
so long as it did not involve him in difficulties of a
nature too serious.</p>

<p>"Mr. Merriwell," she said quickly, "you must leave
Holbrook just as soon as you can!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>"The man who tried to shoot you is here&mdash;the man
with the wicked face and evil eyes."</p>

<p>"I am not given to running away from one man."</p>

<p>"It's not that. He is an assassin! See how he tried
to kill you without giving you a show! You don't
know what moment he may try it again. If he were
to meet you face to face it would be different. You
cannot defend yourself from attacks in the dark. You
have no show."</p>

<p>"Well, there is some truth in that," smiled Merry.</p>

<p>"He will attack you that way again. I know it!
He will strike at you from behind."</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"You must go! You must leave Holbrook before
dark!"</p>

<p>"I hardly fancy it," muttered Frank, frowning. "I
do not like the notion. It leaves an unpleasant taste
in my mouth to think of running away from Cimarron
Bill."</p>

<p>For, although June had not mentioned the ruffian
by name, not knowing it herself, her description of him
had satisfied Frank that it could be no other than the
baffled scoundrel who had twice attempted to seize the
Queen Mystery Mine.</p>

<p>"But you will go?" she urged.</p>

<p>"I'll think of it."</p>

<p>They had reached the post-office and were now
standing in front of the building. Bart Hodge was
sauntering slowly in their direction on the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
side of the street, having kept within easy pistol-shot
of Frank all the while.</p>

<p>Frank's words did not satisfy June. He saw she was
in distress.</p>

<p>"If you will not go for your own sake," she said,
"please do for mine."</p>

<p>He looked astonished.</p>

<p>"For your sake?" he said. "Why, I had not an
idea in the world that it could be of so much concern to you.
I'm afraid I do not understand why it
should be. Now, if Dick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped him with a gesture, her face flushing
very warm.</p>

<p>"Don't!" she entreated, in a low voice. "At least,
you are his own brother! But it is for my sake more
than yours. I cannot explain. Do not embarrass me!
But promise me you will go&mdash;for my sake!"</p>

<p>Having a quick perception, Frank suddenly fancied
he caught an inkling of the truth. In that moment
he saw Mrs. Arlington dealing with Cimarron Bill.
It was a conjecture, but it struck him hard as the
truth.</p>

<p>This, then, was the reason why June wished him
to flee from Holbrook. She feared that her mother
somehow would become involved in the murder in case
Cimarron Bill should carry into execution his dastardly
purpose.</p>

<p>Of course, it was not possible for him to be sure
he had struck upon the truth.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is hard for me to refuse a girl when she corners
me like this," he smiled.</p>

<p>"You'll go?" persisted June.</p>

<p>"If you insist."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you&mdash;thank you! I shall not breathe
easy until I know you are well out of this dreadful
place."</p>

<p>"And I shall not breathe easy as long as I know
you remain here, where you may become subject to
such insults as to-day happened. It is no place for
you at the present time. Holbrook is well enough in
its way; but you are too pretty to walk its streets
without an escort. Western gentlemen are gentlemen
in every sense of the word, and no man can hold the
honor of a lady more sacred; but Western ruffians
are dangerous, and it seems there are several of the
latter class in this place."</p>

<p>"I must remain while mother stays here; I must
stay with her."</p>

<p>The letter was dropped in the post-office, and June
urged Frank to depart at once; but he insisted on
escorting her back to the hotel.</p>

<p>Boxer kept close to their heels, seeming to listen
to their conversation at times; but, strange though it
may appear, he made no attempt to take part in it, nor
did he speak as much as one word during all the time
that he seemed neglected by his master.</p>

<p>Frank made a sign to Bart, who crossed the street
and joined them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have decided to leave town right away," said
Merry. "Have the horses saddled and prepared.
We'll start as soon as I have escorted Miss Arlington
back to the hotel."</p>

<p>Hodge looked surprised.</p>

<p>"The horses are in no condition, Frank," he said.
"You know they are in sore need of a good rest."</p>

<p>"I know it, Bart; but I have a reason for this. We'll
go. Get them ready, please."</p>

<p>"All right," said Bart, as he turned away to carry
out instructions.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<h3>UNTO DEATH!</h3>


<p>The sun was down in the west and night was gathering
over the face of the world when Frank and
Bart rode forth from Holbrook, setting their faces
to the southwest. Boxer trotted behind them.</p>

<p>They were not molested, although Frank remained
in constant expectation of an attack until they were
fairly clear of the place and had it a long rifle-shot at
their backs.</p>

<p>The blue night grew upon the distant plain, and the
stars were coming forth over their heads as they rode
down into the distance, the beating hoofs of the ponies
making rhythm on the baked ground. The first cool
breath of night touched their heated cheeks with grateful
kisses.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to do it, Frank?" asked Bart.</p>

<p>"I found out a thing or two," Merry answered.
"Cimarron Bill is in town, and he was watching his
chance to get another shot at me."</p>

<p>"Another?" exclaimed Bart; upon which Merry explained
how Bill had fired at him already.</p>

<p>"It was rather dangerous to stay there, and I
couldn't resist when a pretty girl took enough interest
in me to urge me to get away," Frank laughed. "We
had some sport with our talking dog, and now&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can't mean to ride far?"</p>

<p>"Remember the hut we passed on the way into town?
It's not very far. We'll stop there to-night."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Bart; and they rode on.</p>

<p>Coming to the deserted hut, they stopped there.
The horses were cared for, and Frank and Bart entered
the hut with their blankets, where they prepared
to sleep until toward morning, planning to rise before
daybreak and get an early start, so that some distance
could be covered ere the sun rose.</p>

<p>Both of the young men were weary, and they lost
little time in drawing their blankets about them and
rolling on the floor. Boxer curled in a corner and went
to sleep. The door of the hut was left open to admit
the cool night air.</p>

<p>Frank fell asleep at once, and Bart was not slow in
following his example.</p>

<p>They were awakened in the middle of the night by
a snarl, a cry, a struggle, and a fall. Both sat up,
grasping their weapons.</p>

<p>The moon was up, and by its light, which streamed
in at the wide-open door, a man and a dog were seen
struggling on the floor. The dog was Boxer, who
had leaped at the throat of the man as he came slipping
in at the open door.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed Hodge. "What's the
meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"One of my friends has arrived," said Frank.
"Boxer has him."</p>

<p>The struggle was fierce and terrible. The dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
seemed to have the man by the throat. Before either
Merry or Hodge could interfere the moonlight glinted
on something bright in the hand of the man, who
struck and struck again.</p>

<p>Not a sound came from the dog. But the bright
thing in the man's hand grew suddenly dark.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" gasped Frank, leaping forward. "He
has a knife!"</p>

<p>Then a terrible sound came from the throat of the
man, and he lifted his arm no more. The thing in
his hand, dark and dripping, fell to the floor of the
hut.</p>

<p>A moment later the man rolled into the shadow, and
then Boxer was seen dragging himself away, while
the man lay still.</p>

<p>"Boxer! Boxer!" cried Frank, bending over the dog.
"Are you hurt, boy? Merciful goodness! he ripped
your whole side open with that knife!"</p>

<p>Hodge struck a light and bent over the man who
lay in the shadow. When the match burned out in his
fingers he dropped it and stepped out to join Merriwell,
who had picked up the dog and carried the creature
into the open air.</p>

<p>Bart found Merry sitting on the ground, with the
dog in his arms. Boxer had been cut in a terrible
manner, and was bleeding in a way that plainly told
his end was near.</p>

<p>"Oh, the wretch!" choked Merry, in a husky voice.
"Oh, the wretch who did this! He ought to be
hanged!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"No need of hanging for him," said Hodge. "He'll
be beyond that in less than three minutes."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's pretty near dead now. Boxer's teeth found
his jugular vein."</p>

<p>"Who was it, Bart?"</p>

<p>"The fellow who made the row in Schlitzenheimer's
saloon."</p>

<p>"Gentle Bob?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"One of Cimarron Bill's hired tools, or I am mistaken!
He followed us here and tried to creep in on
us with that knife, meaning to finish the job at which
he failed in town. Boxer saved us. Good old Boxer!
Poor old Boxer!"</p>

<p>The dog whined a little on hearing this name from
Frank's lip's, and feebly wagged his tail. The moonlight
showed his eyes turned toward Merry's face.</p>

<p>"Is it so bad there's no show for him?" asked Hodge,
in genuine distress.</p>

<p>"No show!" sobbed Frank. "He's finished, Bart!
It's a shame! The most knowing dog in the whole
world! And he has to die like this, killed by a human
being that is more of a beast than he!"</p>

<p>"It's a shame!" said Bart.</p>

<p>The dog licked Frank's hand. Merry bowed his
head, and tears started from his eyes.</p>

<p>"Poor Boxer!" he choked. "Boxer, we have to
part here. You're going to another country, where I
must follow in time. It's all up with you. You may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
find your first master over there; but he'll never love
you more than I have. Good-by, Boxer!"</p>

<p>The dog uttered a whine. And so his life ended in
Frank's arms, with the moonlight falling on them and
the stillness of the Arizona night all around.</p>

<p>Hodge entered the hut, only to come forth, bringing
the blankets and looking very sick.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, let's get away from here!" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"The man in there?"</p>

<p>"Dead!" said Bart. "The place is gory! I'm faint
from it!"</p>

<p>Boxer's body was wrapped in a blanket, and they
mounted and rode away, Frank carrying the dead dog
in his arms to find a burial place where there could be
no chance that his body should be exhumed by any
prowling thing of the desert.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<h3>THE COMING OF CROWFOOT.</h3>


<p>Rap! rap! rap!</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" called Frank. "No need to knock
the door down!"</p>

<p>He flung the door of his cabin wide open, standing
on the threshold.</p>

<p>It was early dawn in Mystery Valley. Sunrise was
beginning to gild the barren peaks of the Mogollons.
The new day had come to its birth in a splendid glow,
and the world smiled refreshed after the cooling sleep
of the departed night.</p>

<p>Frank was just risen and not yet fully dressed, but
about his waist was his cartridge-belt, and his pistol
swung ready in the holster at his hip. He had no use
for the weapon, however.</p>

<p>Outside the door stood old Joe Crowfoot, his blanket
drawn about his shoulders. Those keen eyes gazed
on Merry with an expression of friendly greeting.</p>

<p>With a shout of surprise and joy, Frank clasped the
old redskin in his arms in the most affectionate manner.</p>

<p>"Old Joe Crowfoot, as I live!" he cried, showing
unusual excitement and delight. "Why, you old reprobate,
here you come popping back from the grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
after I've been mourning you as dead! What do you
mean by it, you villain?"</p>

<p>"Ugh!" grunted old Joe, something like a merry
twinkle in those beady eyes. "Strong Heart him think
Crowfoot dead, eh?"</p>

<p>"Hang me if I didn't!"</p>

<p>"Crowfoot him heap tough; no die easy," declared
the Indian.</p>

<p>"I should say not! Why, you tricky scoundrel, they
told me you were done for."</p>

<p>"Who tell so?"</p>

<p>"Some of Cimarron Bill's delectable gang. They
averred they had disposed of you for good and all."</p>

<p>"Waugh! No let such cheap carrion kill me!" said
Joe. "They mebbe think some they do it. Joe he
fool um heap lot."</p>

<p>"But where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Oh, all away round," was the answer, with a wide
sweep of the arm. "Joe him scout&mdash;him find out how
land lay. Do a little biz."</p>

<p>"Do business? What sort of business?"</p>

<p>"Catch the sucker some."</p>

<p>"Catch the sucker? What's that?"</p>

<p>The redskin flung open his dirty red blanket and
tapped a fat belt about his waist, which gave back a
musical clink.</p>

<p>"Play the game of poke'," he exclaimed. "Make
heap plenty mon'."</p>

<p>"You've been gambling again?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Strong Heart him guess," nodded Joe, with something
like a sly smile.</p>

<p>"You villain! And I'll wager you got away with
your ill-gotten spoils."</p>

<p>"Heap do so," said Joe. "Have some firewater.
Find one, two, three, four crooked paleface follow
to kill and rob. Let firewater 'lone till fool crooked
palefaces so um no follow some more. Then go safe
place drink firewater a heap."</p>

<p>"You've been drunk, too!" cried Merry.</p>

<p>"Mebbe so," admitted the Indian. "White man
firewater heap good while um last; heap bad when um
gone. Make um feel much glad at first, then much
sorry little time after."</p>

<p>Frank laughed heartily at the queer manner of the
old Indian as he said this.</p>

<p>"I suppose that's about right," he said. "I've never
tried it to find out."</p>

<p>"Strong Heart him no try firewater?" exclaimed
Joe, in surprise. "Crowfoot him think all paleface
drink the firewater."</p>

<p>"Well, here is one who doesn't. I've seen too much
trouble come from the stuff."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Strong Heart him got heap more sense than
anybody Joe ever see," asserted the Indian admiringly.
"Once git taste of firewater, always be heap fool and
drink him some. Many times old Joe he say no drink
some more. Head all swell, middle all sick, mouth all
dry, taste nasty a lot, bone ache&mdash;then him say no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the firewater. Mebbe he go 'long some time, but
bimeby he take it some more. White man make firewater.
Bad! bad! bad! No firewater made, nobody
drink it."</p>

<p>From inside the cabin a voice called.</p>

<p>"What, ho! Methinks thou hast found a philosopher,
Merry! Bring the sage in that I may survey him
with my heavenly blue eyes."</p>

<p>"Yes, dew!" drawled another voice. "I want to
set my eyes onter him, by gum!"</p>

<p>Merry led the old Indian into the cabin.</p>

<p>"Here he is," Merry laughed. "Crowfoot, these are
some of my friends, whom you met last summer. You
remember them. They played ball with me in the Mad
River country."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" grunted the redskin. "Heap remember!"</p>

<p>Bart Hodge stepped forward, his hand outstretched
to the Indian.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you again, Crowfoot," he said.</p>

<p>"Me same," said Joe, shaking Bart's hand. "You
heap good to ketch hard ball when Strong Heart him
make it go fast like a bullet and man with stick he&mdash;whish!&mdash;strike
at it so, no hit it at all."</p>

<p>They all laughed at the Indian's manner of describing
Bart's skill at catching.</p>

<p>"Consarned if it ain't a sight fer sore eyes to see ye,
Mr. Crowfoot!" said Ephraim Gallup, as he froze to
the redskin's hand and shook it warmly. "Yeou was
the best mascot a baseball-team ever hed."</p>

<p>"How! how!" said the old fellow. "Nose Talk him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
stand way out far, ketch ball when it come there.
How! how!"</p>

<p>"Nose Talk!" laughed Frank. "Well, that's one on
you, Gallup!"</p>

<p>Jack Ready was smiling blandly. He gave his hand
a little flirt in salute, and stepped forward with an odd
movement.</p>

<p>"Gaze on my classic features, Joseph Crowfoot, Esquire,"
he invited. "See if you can recollect what I
did in the game."</p>

<p>"Sure remember," nodded Crowfoot. "Talk-talk a
heap, no do much else."</p>

<p>Then the joke was on Jack, and even Bart Hodge
was forced to smile, while Gallup gave Ready a resounding
smack on the shoulder with his open hand.</p>

<p>"Bless my punkins!" snickered the Vermonter.
"That's a thunderin' good one on you, Jack!"</p>

<p>Ready looked sad.</p>

<p>"Alas!" he sighed. "Is it thus I am to be defamed!
And by a copper-colored aborigine! The thought is
gall to my sensitive soul! I shall peek and pine over
it! For days to come no sweet smile shall adorn my
beautiful features!"</p>

<p>Joe looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"No say something bad," he declared. "When Red
Cheek him talk-talk a heap lot other man that throw
ball he got a lot mixed, no make good pitch. Red
Cheek him help win game a heap."</p>

<p>Jack's face cleared at once.</p>

<p>"Crowfoot, you have poured soothing balm on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
wounded heart!" he cried. "I'm glad to know that
I do amount to something, for, so help me! of late I
have begun to wonder what I was made for!"</p>

<p>"Sit down, Joe," invited Frank. "We're going to
have breakfast in a short time, and you are to eat
with us."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" said the Indian, disdaining a chair and sitting
on the floor with his back against the wall. "Joe
him do so. Him a heap empty. Mebbe after him eat
him tell Strong Heart something much good to hear."</p>

<p>When breakfast was over the old Indian lighted his
rank pipe and smoked contentedly, still sitting on the
floor, with his back against the wall.</p>

<p>Through the open door came the sounds of work
at the mine. Frank was not yet running the mine day
and night, with shifts of men, but it was his intention
to do so later. Smoke was rising from the high pipe
of the stamp-mill, and soon the stamps began to rumble
and roar, awaking the echoes of the valley. The
sound was a pleasant one in Merriwell's ears.</p>

<p>"This running a mine in Arizona is a snap," said
Jack Ready, as he elevated his feet to the top of the
table, in which the breakfast-dishes and remnants of
the meal remained. "The hardest part of it seems to
be washing the dishes. It's Gallup's turn this morning."</p>

<p>"Not by a thuttering sight!" exclaimed Ephraim.
"Yeou can't shoulder that onter me! You've gotter
wash the dishes to-day. I done it yisterday."</p>

<p>"Is it possible!" cried Jack. "Why, I thought it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
was day before yesterday, or, perchance, the day before
that. Alas, how time flies&mdash;tempus fugit!"</p>

<p>"Now, don't go to springin' any Latin on us!"
growled Gallup. "You never learned enough Latin
to hurt ye, an' ye don't want to try to show off."</p>

<p>"Behold how the green-eyed monster turneth a
friend into a critic!" said Jack.</p>

<p>"You can attend to the dishes later," said Frank.
"Just now I am anxious to hear the good news Crowfoot
said he might have to tell. What is it, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Some time little while 'go, few days, you be in
Holbrook?" questioned the Indian, pulling away at his
pipe.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was there&mdash;Hodge and myself."</p>

<p>"Joe him been there since."</p>

<p>"And you bring good news from that place?"</p>

<p>"Heap good to Strong Heart. In Holbrook him
find white woman who hate him a lot, eh? White
woman she is the squaw of man who make for Strong
Heart big trouble 'bout mine."</p>

<p>"You mean Mrs. Arlington?"</p>

<p>"Ugh! Mebbe that her name."</p>

<p>"That is it. She is in Holbrook, or was a few days
ago."</p>

<p>"She hate Strong Heart a heap."</p>

<p>"I reckon she does," nodded Frank, wondering how
the old redskin found out so much.</p>

<p>"She come to get bad men to take mine."</p>

<p>"Possibly that is right."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Joe him know it. She make much business with
Cim'run Bill."</p>

<p>"That I suspected, although I did not find it out for
a certainty while in Holbrook."</p>

<p>"It so."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"She give Bill heap much mon' to buy bad men to
take from Strong Heart the mine."</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Waugh! Joe him find out. Joe he play sharp; he
listen."</p>

<p>"Crowfoot, you're as good as a detective."</p>

<p>"No know 'bout that. Find out white squaw she
hate Strong Heart, then try to find out more. Now
squaw she heap sorry she come to Holbrook."</p>

<p>"She is sorry?"</p>

<p>"Heap so."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"She have papoose girl with her&mdash;young squaw."</p>

<p>"Her daughter June."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Now she no have young squaw."</p>

<p>"What's that? What do you mean by that. What
has become of June?"</p>

<p>"You tell," said Joe, with a strange gesture. "She
gone. Old squaw tear hair, tear run from her eye,
she make a loud weep. Ha! Now you hear good
news, Strong Heart! Now you know your enemy
have the great sorrow! That make your heart much
glad!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>But Frank was on his feet now, his face rather pale
and a look of excitement in his eyes.</p>

<p>"See here, Crowfoot," he said, "do you mean to
tell me that June Arlington has disappeared and that
her mother does not know what has become of her?"</p>

<p>Joe nodded.</p>

<p>"Laugh!" he said. "Laugh, Strong Heart!"</p>

<p>But Frank did not laugh; instead, to the wonderment
of the Indian, he betrayed both consternation
and dismay.</p>

<p>"Are you sure of this, Joe?" he demanded. "How
long had the girl been missing when you left Holbrook?"</p>

<p>"The sun had slept once."</p>

<p>"By which you mean that one night had passed?"</p>

<p>"Ugh!"</p>

<p>"Then this is serious, indeed! Something most
unfortunate has happened, or June Arlington would
not be missing overnight. Boys, prepare at once to
start for Holbrook! Get ready to mount and ride
as fast as horseflesh can carry us; We'll start at the
earliest moment possible!"</p>

<p>Crowfoot arose, a look of wonderment in his dark
eyes. He reached out and grasped Frank's arm.</p>

<p>"What would Strong Heart do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm going to Holbrook hotfoot," was the answer.
"I'm going to find out, if possible, what has happened
to June Arlington, and I shall do my best to return her
to her mother, if she has not already returned when I
reach there."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>The redskin's hand dropped from Merriwell's arm
and the old fellow stared at the white man in uncomprehending
amazement.</p>

<p>"Why so?" he asked. "Paleface squaw she hate
you, she is your enemy. Now she have something to
think a heap of, and no time to make trouble for
Strong Heart. He should have a great happiness that
it is so. Why does he hurry to the bad white squaw?
Is it to laugh at her? Is it to see her weep and
cry?"</p>

<p>"No, Crowfoot; it is to find out, if possible, what
has happened to the girl, just as I said a moment ago,
and to return her to her mother."</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head.</p>

<p>"Waugh! No understand!" he declared. "Strong
Heart him much strange."</p>

<p>"Joe, will you go with us? You shall have a good
horse. I may need your aid. Will you go?"</p>

<p>"Joe him go. No understand; him go, all same."</p>

<p>"Then hustle, fellows!" cried Frank. "We'll be off
soon!"</p>

<p>He rushed from the cabin.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<h3>ARRESTED IN HOLBROOK.</h3>


<p>Another morning was dawning when five weary
horses bore five persons into the town of Holbrook.
The animals had been pushed to the utmost, and the
riders showed signs of deep fatigue. The dust of the
desert lay white upon men and beasts.</p>

<p>At the head of the party rode Frank Merriwell,
showing of them all the least weariness, his lips pressed
together with an expression of grim determination.</p>

<p>Bart, Jack, and Ephraim were behind, with old Joe
bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Straight to the hotel they went, where Frank learned
immediately that Mrs. Arlington was still there, and
he also found out that she was very ill, having been
completely prostrated by the vanishing of June, who
was still missing.</p>

<p>When Frank asked to see the woman he was told
that the doctor attending her had said no one was to
see her without his permission.</p>

<p>"Then I must see that doctor in a hurry," Merry
declared. "Where can I find him?"</p>

<p>He was directed and hastened to the home of the
doctor, who proved to be a red-faced, pompous little
fellow.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Impossible to see the lady," declared the doctor.
"She has heart trouble, and it might prove fatal. I
cannot permit it."</p>

<p>"See here, doctor," said Frank, "I have ridden a
right good distance to see her, having heard of the disappearance
of her daughter June. I have come to see
what I can do about tracing the missing girl and
restoring her to her mother. To start the work right,
I should have an interview with the lady."</p>

<p>"Hum! hum!" coughed the doctor. "I don't know
about it." He shook his head, but Merriwell caught
his eye and continued to talk earnestly until the man
gradually ceased his opposition.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's not just the wisest thing," he said.
"But still it is anxiety over her daughter that has
brought her to this pitiful condition. If you can do
anything to relieve that anxiety, it may be better than
medicine. But you must take care not to excite her
more than possible."</p>

<p>This Frank readily promised, and they set out for
the hotel.</p>

<p>Having ascended to the rooms occupied by Mrs.
Arlington and those she had brought with her, the
doctor entered first, being admitted by the faithful
colored maid. In a few moments he came out and
said:</p>

<p>"I forgot to ask your name, but Mrs. Arlington
says she will see you. Come in."</p>

<p>Frank followed the doctor into the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arlington, partly dressed, was reclining on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
couch, propped up amid cushions. She was very pale
and showed signs of great worriment and grief.</p>

<p>The moment her eyes rested on Frank, who came
forward, hat in hand, she gave a great cry and started
up. The doctor hurried to her side, cautioning her
against becoming excited, but she appeared to heed
him not in the least.</p>

<p>"You?" she cried, pointing at Frank. "You have
dared to come here?"</p>

<p>Merry bowed.</p>

<p>"I know of no reason why I should not come here,"
he said. "I have heard of your misfortune, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wretch!" the woman panted, glaring at him. "How
dare you! I'll have you arrested at once!"</p>

<p>Frank was surprised by this reception, but he kept
his composure, although he was struck by a thought
that the woman must be mad.</p>

<p>"Why should you have me arrested?" he asked.
"For defending my property? I scarcely think you
will do that, madam!"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you scoundrel!" panted Mrs. Arlington,
pointing at him. "Where is my daughter? You shall
never leave this place until you restore her to me!"</p>

<p>This did stagger Merry somewhat.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Arlington," he said, "I have come to offer
my services in searching for your daughter. If I can
be of any assistance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you lured her away!" declared the shaking
woman. "You were seen talking with her on the
street. Is this the way you defend your property? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
know your game! You mean to make me promise to
drop the battle against you, on which condition you
will restore June to me! I have been told that you
would try that trick! But I am ready for you, and
you shall be arrested immediately. You have walked
into the trap!"</p>

<p>"My dear woman," said Merry quietly, "you never
were more mistaken in all your life. I know absolutely
nothing of the whereabouts of your daughter;
but I fancied you might be able to tell me something
that would serve as a clue in the search for her."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me that! I have sense enough to know
you would not offer to help me find her!"</p>

<p>Startled by the sound of Mrs. Arlington's excited
voice, Eliot Dodge, her agent, who was in an adjoining
room, now entered quickly. When he saw Merriwell
he stopped short.</p>

<p>Frank had met Dodge once in Denver, at which
time the man with the blue nose had made him an
offer in behalf of the mining syndicate for the San
Pablo and Queen Mystery Mines, an offer that Merry
had scornfully declined. Now Frank recognized the
crafty fox of a lawyer at once.</p>

<p>"So you are here, Dodge?" he said. "And I fancy
you are behind some of the doings that have been
going on in this region of late."</p>

<p>Dodge puckered up his mouth and tried to look at
the young man with something like contempt, although
the effort was a failure.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am here," he said, in his raspy voice; "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
I fancy it is a pretty good thing for Mrs. Arlington
that I am. I have been able to show her the inwardness
of this last move of yours."</p>

<p>"Then you are the one who has filled her mind with
the idea that I know something of the whereabouts
of Miss Arlington? Well, Dodge, I know you are
not a fool, and, therefore, I must conclude at once
that you have some rascally reason for giving her such
an impression. Be careful, sir, that you do not make
a false step! In this part of the country it is very
dangerous. Down here men are sometimes lynched
for rascality."</p>

<p>"Don't you dare threaten me!" fumed Dodge, shaking
his fist at Frank. "There is a warrant out for
your arrest, and you'll find that the end of your career
is pretty near."</p>

<p>Frank smiled derisively.</p>

<p>"You remind me of a snapping cur, Dodge," he
observed; then he turned from the man, as if not deigning
to waste further words on him. "Mrs. Arlington,"
he said earnestly, "I assure you on my honor that I
have come to you with the most friendly intentions.
I assure you that I have ridden more than one hundred
miles for the purpose of offering my services
in the search for your daughter. You may not believe
me, but it is the simple truth. You have received
me in a manner most disheartening; but I understand
that your nervous condition must be the excuse.</p>

<p>"I am not your enemy. I do not wish to fight you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
I am fighting the Consolidated Mining Association of
America. I would not like to think that I have a
woman among my enemies, who have hired murderers
and ruffians to try to seize my property! Such a
thought is most distasteful to me. I have had the
pleasure of meeting your daughter, and I found her
a most charming girl. I was interested in her. When
I learned that she had disappeared I lost not a moment
in gathering a few friends and starting for this
place. We have covered the ground as fast as possible,
taking the heat into consideration. If any one
has told you that I am even remotely connected with
the disappearance of Miss June that person has lied
to you and deceived you. If you will give me a little
aid, I shall exert myself to the utmost to restore June
to your arms. That is all I have to say."</p>

<p>She heard him through with impatience. Frank
saw before he had finished that her mind was set and
that he had wasted his breath.</p>

<p>"Like your brother," said the woman passionately,
"you are a scoundrel! Like him, you assume the airs
of a gentleman. I know your tricks, and I am not
deceived. You have been told that there is a warrant
out for your arrest. It is true&mdash;and here is the officer
to serve it!"</p>

<p>Behind Merry there was a heavy step. He turned
and found himself face to face with a plain, quiet-looking
man, who promptly said:</p>

<p>"Are you Frank Merriwell?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then let me tell you that I am Ben File, city
marshal of Holbrook, and you are my prisoner! If
you try to pull a gun, I'll shoot you in your tracks!"</p>

<p>Frank showed his nerve then. He did not even
change color, although the arrest had fallen upon him
so suddenly.</p>

<p>"Your words are plain enough, sir," he said. "There
is no reason why I should provoke you into shooting
me, as I have nothing to fear from arrest."</p>

<p>"I have been led to understand that you are a very
dangerous character," said File, looking Merry over
in some surprise. "You do not seem so at first
glance."</p>

<p>Frank smiled a bit.</p>

<p>"I assure you I am not in the least dangerous," he
said. "I surrender without the least resistance."</p>

<p>Eliot Dodge stood in the background, rubbing his
hands together and grinning.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dodge," said the city marshal, "will you be
good enough to relieve this young man of his weapons."</p>

<p>"Eh?" said Dodge nervously. "I&mdash;I&mdash;yes, sir."</p>

<p>He came forward and took Frank's revolvers, handling
them gingerly, as if fearing they would explode
in his hands. He passed them over to File, who afterward
searched Merry himself.</p>

<p>In spite of Frank's coolness, he was indignant over
the outrage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arlington astonished the doctor by seeming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
stronger and better than she had been since it was
known that June had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Now I have you!" she said exultantly. "If you
do not tell me at once where my daughter may be
found it will go still harder with you."</p>

<p>Merry gave her a look of pity.</p>

<p>"Madam," he said, "I fear that you are not in your
right senses. Your action in coming to this part of
the country and bringing your daughter here, where
you have had dealings with ruffians, confirms me in
this belief. I cannot believe you would do such things
if perfectly sane."</p>

<p>"You insult me!" she exclaimed, tossing her head.
"But you shall pay dearly for your insults! The law
will punish you!"</p>

<p>"And are you to stand clear of the law&mdash;you, who
have incited ruffians to attack me and my property? I
am well aware that law and justice may frequently be
two different things; but I fancy it will be to your discomfort
to have the whole truth come out. I know
a ruffian called Cimarron Bill fired at me from the
window of this very room. How came he here unless
by your permission? And were you in partnership
with a man of his character in an attempted murder?"</p>

<p>Frank's fearless words struck home, and the woman
turned pale, in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor!" she said, sinking back on the couch.</p>

<p>The astonished physician, who had remained dumb
and staring through the most of this scene, now cried
to Frank:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>"See what you have done! See what you have
done!"</p>

<p>"She brought it on herself," retorted Merry, turning
away, his heart hardened toward the woman. "I
have ridden a hundred miles to do everything in my
power to find her daughter and restore her to her
mother, and I am&mdash;arrested!"</p>

<p>There was deep bitterness in his tone and manner.</p>

<p>"Mr. File," he said, "I am ready to go with you,
sir."</p>

<p>"Hold! Wait!" called Mrs. Arlington from the
couch. "Tell me where you have taken my daughter!"</p>

<p>Frank gave her a look, shook his head a bit, and
again turned away.</p>

<p>"Oh, tell me!" pleaded the wretched mother. "I
can't bear this suspense! My poor June!"</p>

<p>Then she sat bolt upright and almost screamed:</p>

<p>"If you harm a hair of her head, I'll make you regret
it until the day of your death! You'll be conpelled
to tell! I'm going to see that you are sent to
prison! I'll make a convict of you!"</p>

<p>Frank did not retort. As he was walking out with
File's hand on his shoulder, the woman fell on her
knees and begged him to restore her daughter.</p>

<p>"Too bad!" said Merry, when the door was closed.
"I believe she really thinks I know something about
the girl."</p>

<p>File said nothing until they had descended to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
street. On the steps of the hotel he paused and looked
hard at Frank.</p>

<p>"Young man," he said, "you don't act to me like
a desperado. I'm mightily disappointed in you. From
what I heard, I supposed you a ruffian. To tell you
the truth, I'm rather inclined in your favor."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Frank, with a bit of bitterness.
"Little good that does me, although I am grateful to
know that I have not become villainous in appearance.
I came here to do that woman a favor, knowing all
the while that she hated me, and this is the way I have
been received."</p>

<p>"Why did you take so much pains to come?"</p>

<p>"Because I know her daughter, a handsome, refined,
noble-hearted girl. It was not for the woman's
sake, but for her daughter's that I put myself to the
trouble that has drawn me into this scrape, Mr. File.
Tell me, what has been done to find and rescue June
Arlington?"</p>

<p>"Everything possible," said the city marshal. "But
the girl seems to have disappeared off the face of the
earth. She vanished in the very heart of this town,
too. It's a most mysterious affair. Mr. Merriwell, I
regret that my duty compelled me to place you under
arrest and now compels me to lock you up. I hope
circumstances may give you your freedom very soon."</p>

<p>Frank was somewhat touched by these simple words.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," he said. "But you had better get me
under lock and key before my friends find out what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
has happened. They might raise trouble, and I don't
want to see anybody hurt over this affair."</p>

<p>So they started down the street, walking side by
side, like two friends. File did not even keep a hand
on Merry.</p>

<p>They had proceeded but a short distance when a
man suddenly appeared in the open doorway of a
saloon. Frank saw the pistol in the man's hand, and
he recognized his mortal enemy, Cimarron Bill.</p>

<p>As Bill appeared in that doorway, Merry knew
the fellow's purpose was to make a second attempt
to kill him, and Frank was unarmed and defenseless,
under arrest at the time.</p>

<p>As Bill's weapon came up Frank made a sidelong
spring. He did this at the very instant, it seemed,
that the revolver spoke. The fact was that he sprang
a trifle before the shot was fired. His movement
seemed much like that of a man death-smitten by a
bullet, and Cimarron Bill dodged back at once, believing
he had accomplished his dastardly purpose.</p>

<p>Frank was not touched.</p>

<p>But the bullet meant for him had found a human
target. Ben File swayed from side to side, his legs
buckling beneath him, and fell into Merriwell's arms.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>

<h3>BILL HIKES OUT.</h3>


<p>"Got it!" whispered File huskily. "He nailed me
good and plenty that time!"</p>

<p>Without a word, fearing Cimarron Bill might discover
he had shot the wrong man and seek to rectify
his bad work, Frank lifted File in his muscular arms
and ran into a store with him.</p>

<p>The city marshal was stretched on a counter.</p>

<p>"Send for a doctor!" commanded Merry. "And
turn out a posse to take Cimarron Bill. He fired the
shot."</p>

<p>At the mention of Cimarron Bill, however, consternation
reigned. The desperado was all too well
known in Holbrook, and scarcely a man in all the
place cared to face him.</p>

<p>"No use," said File faintly. "Nobody'll dare touch
Bill. He'll get out of town deliberately without being
molested."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Merry.  "Why, you don't
mean to say they will let that murderous hound escape?"</p>

<p>"He'll escape now that I'm flat. There's not a man
in Holbrook that dares face him."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're mistaken!" said Merry. "There is one
man!"</p>

<p>"What one?"</p>

<p>"This one!"</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I dare face that man! Give me my weapons
and I'll go out and get him!"</p>

<p>Ben File looked at the boyish young man incredulously.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you're talking about," he
said, as they were trying to stop the bleeding of his
wound, which was in his left side. "That man has a
record. He's the deadliest ruffian in Arizona. He
would kill you."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said Frank. "I've seen his
like before. Give me my revolvers, and I'll go take
him. I'll bring him to you if you live!"</p>

<p>File fumbled in his huge pockets and brought out
Merry's long-barreled revolvers.</p>

<p>"Go ahead if you want to," he said. "Somehow I
take stock in you, though I'm afraid it's your funeral
you're going to. Anyhow, if I'm booked to cash in,
I don't mind giving you a show to levant. Here comes
the doctor."</p>

<p>The same red-faced little man came rushing into the
store, brought there by a messenger who had gone in
search of him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank examined his weapons, and then walked out
of the store.</p>

<p>There was considerable excitement on the street,
caused by the shooting. Merry minded no one, yet
kept his eyes wide open for every one. As fast as
he could step he proceeded straight to the open door
from which Cimarron Bill had fired the shot. He
had a pistol in either hand when he stepped through
that doorway.</p>

<p>As he had expected, it was a saloon. Three persons
were in the room, but Cimarron Bill was not there.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Merry, "I'll be obliged if you
will tell me where I can find the white-livered cur who
just shot Ben File from this doorway."</p>

<p>They stared at him as if doubting their senses.</p>

<p>"If it's Cimarron Bill you're looking for, young
man," one of them finally said, "take my advice and
don't. It's the most onhealthy occupation you can engage
in, and I advise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut out the advice," said Merry sharply; "and tell
me where the cowardly dog has gone."</p>

<p>"He ambled out o' yere directly arter doin' the
shootin', and we last sees him lopin' down the street
that-a-way. But you wants to keep a heap long distance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Frank waited for no more. He was satisfied that
Bill had departed just as the man said, and he wheeled
at once and started down the street.</p>

<p>Merry knew full well what sort of mission he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
undertaken, but he was not daunted in the least by
its magnitude. Cimarron Bill was his deadly foe, but
he now saw his opportunity to bring the ruffian to an
accounting for his crimes, and he did not propose to
let the chance slip.</p>

<p>So he inquired as he passed down the street and
found that Bill had hurried to the saloon kept by
Schlitzenheimer.</p>

<p>Again Merry had his pistols ready when he entered
the saloon. Early though it was, he found four men
there engaged in a game of draw poker, and one of
the four was old Joe Crowfoot.</p>

<p>Schlitzenheimer gave a shout when he saw Frank.</p>

<p>"My gootness!" he cried. "How you vos? Vere
vos dot dalking tog alretty? I vouldt like to blay dot
tog anodder came beenuckle of."</p>

<p>Frank was disappointed once more in failing to discover
Cimarron Bill. He asked if the man had been
there.</p>

<p>"He vos," nodded Schlitzenheimer. "Und avay he
dit his saddle take."</p>

<p>"He took his saddle?"</p>

<p>"Yah."</p>

<p>"Then his saddle was here?"</p>

<p>"It he dit keep here, vor id vos very valueless," said
the Dutchman. "He vos avraid stolen id would pe. I
know Pill. Ven he come und say, 'Vritz, you tookit
my saddles und keepit it a vile undil vor id I call,' I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
say, 'Yah, you pet.' I haf nod any anxiety him to
make some drouble by."</p>

<p>"If he came for his saddle it is likely he meant to
use it. Was he in a hurry?"</p>

<p>"Der piggest hurry I ever knewn him to pe indo.
Ven I invortationed him to a drink take, he said he
could not sdop vor id."</p>

<p>"He's on the run!" exclaimed Frank. "Where does
he keep his horse when in town?"</p>

<p>"Ad Dorvelt's shust down a liddle vays."</p>

<p>Frank almost ran from the saloon and hurried down
the street to Dorfelt's stable.</p>

<p>He was stared at in the same wondering amazement
when he asked for Cimarron Bill.</p>

<p>"Mebbe you has urgent business with that gent?"
said one man.</p>

<p>"I have," answered Merry. "He shot Ben File
about ten minutes ago, and I am after him."</p>

<p>"Waal, you'll have to hustle to ketch him, an' I
'lows it's jest as well fer you. His hoss was saddled
jest now, an' I opine he's well out o' town by this
time."</p>

<p>Frank listened to hear no more. On the run, he
set out to find his friends.</p>

<p>Singularly enough, not one of them knew anything
of his arrest, although they had heard of the shooting.
He found them in short order, and what he told them
in a very few words stirred them from lassitude to the
greatest excitement.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fellows," he said, "I'm going to run Cimarron
Bill down if it takes a year! I've given my word to
Ben File that I would bring Bill back. I mean to make
good. Are you with me in this chase?"</p>

<p>They were with him to a man.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<h3>OLD JOE TAKES A DRINK.</h3>


<p>Away on the horizon, riding to the southeast, was a
black speck of a horseman as Frank, Bart, Jack, and
Ephraim galloped out of town on fresh mounts secured
by Merry.</p>

<p>"There he is!" cried Frank. "We mustn't lose him!
We must keep him in view and run him down before
nightfall. Can we do it?"</p>

<p>"We can try!" said Bart grimly.</p>

<p>These young fellows seemed made of iron. All
their weariness had vanished, and they sat in their
saddles like young Centaurs, with the exception of
Gallup, who could not be graceful at anything.</p>

<p>"This is what might well be called the strenuous
life," observed Jack Ready. "It's almost too much
for my delicate constitution. I fear my health will be
undermined and my lovely complexion will be ruined."</p>

<p>"He has seen us," declared Frank. "He knows we
are after him! It's going to be a hard chase."</p>

<p>"How about June Arlington?" asked Bart.</p>

<p>"When I gave Ben File my word to bring Cimarron
Bill back I was under arrest for kidnaping June Arlington.
Had I not made that promise I might still
be under arrest. I must keep my word to File. I
hope to do something for June later."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>So they rode into the scorching desert, seeming to be
gaining on the man ahead for a time.</p>

<p>The sun poured down mercilessly. Alkali dust rose
and filled their nostrils. Red lizards flashed before
them on the ground at rare intervals. And far ahead
the black speck held into the distance.</p>

<p>"He knows where he's going, fellows," said Frank.
"He's not the man to strike blindly into the desert.
He'll come to water and feed before his horse gives
out, and so we must find the same."</p>

<p>But fate seemed against them. Afar on the desert
a haze arose and grew and became a beautiful lake, its
shores lined with waving trees. And in this mirage
the fugitive was swallowed up and lost. When the lake
faded and vanished the black speck could be seen nowhere
on the plain.</p>

<p>"Vanished into a gully of some sort," said Frank.
"We must find just what has become of him."</p>

<p>So they kept on; but in time they came to feel that
the search was useless. Water they had brought for
themselves, together with some canned food; but the
only relief they could give the horses was by pouring
a little water over a sponge and wiping out the dry
mouths of the poor animals.</p>

<p>They were forced to turn aside and seek some hills,
where Frank felt certain there was a spring.</p>

<p>Thus it was that nightfall found them at the spring,
but Cimarron Bill was gone, none of them knew where.
There was feed for the horses in the little valley, and
they made the best of it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank was far from pleased. Everything had gone
wrong since their arrival in Holbrook, and the prospect
was most discouraging.</p>

<p>"By gum! it's too bad to hev to give it up," said
Ephraim.</p>

<p>Frank shot him a look.</p>

<p>"I have no intention of giving it up," he said. "But
I confess that I made one bad mistake."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"I left Crowfoot back there in Schlitzenheimer's saloon
playing poker."</p>

<p>"You think he'll be skinned, do you?" said Bart.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not worrying about that. The old reprobate
can take care of himself. I knew it would be
almost impossible to drag him away from that game,
and that was why I did not bother with him. Didn't
want to lose the time. But that redskin can follow a
trail that would bother a bloodhound. If we had taken
him at the start, he'd never lost the scent."</p>

<p>They lay on the ground and watched the heavens
fill with bright stars. The heat of the day melted into
coolness, and all knew it would be cold before morning.</p>

<p>Frank had anticipated that they might have to
spend the night in this manner, and blankets had been
brought.</p>

<p>They seemed alone in the wild waste, with no living
thing save their horses within miles and miles. So,
with no fear of attack, they wrapped their blankets
about them and slept.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>The wind swept almost icy through the little valley
before morning dawned. As the eastern sky grew pale
Frank opened his eyes and sat up.</p>

<p>A moment later a shout from his lips aroused the
others.</p>

<p>Merry was staring at a familiar figure in a dirty
red blanket. In their very midst old Joe lay stretched,
and apparently he had been sleeping as soundly as any
of them. Nor were his slumbers broken by Merry's
shout, which astounded Frank beyond measure, for
never before had he known the old fellow to sleep like
that. Always when he had stirred he had found the
beady eyes of the redskin upon him.</p>

<p>"Behold!" said Jack Ready. "Lo, the noble red
man is again within our midst. But how came it
thus?"</p>

<p>"Waal, may I be honswizzled!" grunted Gallup.</p>

<p>Frank flung aside his blanket.</p>

<p>"Something is the matter with him!" he said, in a
tone that indicated anxiety. "If there wasn't, he'd
not sleep this way. I wonder what it is. Is he dead?"</p>

<p>But when the red blanket was pulled down it was
found that Joe lay with a quart bottle clasped to his
heart in a loving embrace. The bottle was fully two-thirds
empty.</p>

<p>"That explains it!" said Merry, in deep disgust.
"The old dog is drunk as a lord! That's how we happen
to have the pleasure of finding him asleep. I'll
give any man fifty dollars who will catch him asleep
when he is perfectly sober."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a picture he doth present!" said Ready.
"Look upon it! And yet there is something in it to
bring sadness to the heart. Behold how tenderly he
doth hold the long-necker to his manly buzzum! 'Tis
thus that many a chap hugs a destroyer to his heart."</p>

<p>"The old sinner!" said Hodge. "I don't see how
he got here without arousing any of us. There's his
horse, picketed near the other animals."</p>

<p>Frank stooped and tried to take the bottle from
Joe's clasp, but the sleeping Indian held it fast.</p>

<p>"Go heap better five dol's," he muttered in his sleep.</p>

<p>"He's still playing poker," said Frank.</p>

<p>He gave Crowfoot a hard shake.</p>

<p>"Wake up, you copper-colored sot!" he cried.
"Wake up and see what you've got in your hands."</p>

<p>"Four king," mumbled Joe thickly. "Heap good!"</p>

<p>At this the boys laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty good hand!" said Frank. "It takes
four aces or a straight flush to beat it."</p>

<p>Then he wrenched the bottle away, whereupon the
redskin awoke at once.</p>

<p>"Mine! mine!" he exclaimed, sitting up.</p>

<p>"It's poison," said Frank, and smashed the bottle.</p>

<p>With a snarl of fury, the Indian staggered to his
feet and made for Merry, drawing a wicked-looking
knife.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried Gallup, in consternation.</p>

<p>Frank leaped to meet old Joe, clutching his wrists
and holding him helpless, while he gazed sternly into
the bloodshot eyes of the drunken old man.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's this, Crowfoot?" he demanded. "Would
you strike Strong Heart with a knife? Would you
destroy the brother of Indian Heart? Has the poison
firewater of the white man robbed you of your
senses?"</p>

<p>"Firewater Joe's!" exclaimed the redskin. "No
right to spill um! No right! No right!"</p>

<p>"I did it for your own good, Crowfoot," said Merry
quietly. "You are in bad shape now. I want you to
come out of it. You may be able to help us. What
you need is a good drink of water."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Water heap good. Joe he take some."</p>

<p>Immediately Frank released the old man's wrists,
and Joe slipped his knife out of sight with something
like a show of shame.</p>

<p>In another moment Merry had his canteen, filled it
at the spring, and handed it to Crowfoot, who gravely
took it and began to drink. The boys stood around,
and their eyes bulged as the old man held the canteen
to his mouth, tipping it more and more skyward, a deep
gurgling coming from his throat. He continued to
drink until the canteen was quite emptied, when he
lowered it with perfect gravity, wiped his lips with the
back of his hand, and observed:</p>

<p>"Joe him a little dry!"</p>

<p>"Well, I should say so!" smiled Frank. "Your interior
must have been as parched as an alkali desert,
Joe."</p>

<p>"If he takes many drinks like that," said Ready,
with a queer twist of his mug, "there'll be a drought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
in this country that will make an ordinary dry spell
look like a back number."</p>

<p>Crowfoot did not smile. Giving back the canteen,
he sat down on the ground, resting his elbows on his
knees and taking his head in his hands. He was the
picture of misery and dejection.</p>

<p>"Injun big fool!" he groaned. "Last night feel
much good; to-day feel a lot bad. Big pain in head."</p>

<p>"We've all been there many's the time," sang Jack
Ready softly.</p>

<p>Then the eccentric chap sat down on the ground beside
the redskin, about whom he placed an arm.</p>

<p>"Joseph," he said, "methinks I know how it is! I
have felt that way heap often. Ugh! Sick all over."</p>

<p>Joe grunted.</p>

<p>"Nothing worth living for."</p>

<p>Another grunt.</p>

<p>"Much rather be dead with the beautiful daisies
growing on my grave than living in such misery."</p>

<p>Again a grunt.</p>

<p>"Internal organs all out of gear, stomach on a strike,
head bigger than a barrel. Are those the symptoms,
Joseph?"</p>

<p>"Much so," confessed old Joe.</p>

<p>"Joseph, you have my sympathy. You've never
been to college, but you have received part of a college
education. I have taken my degree in that branch.
I'm a P. M. of J. C.&mdash;Past Master of Jag Carriers.
But I have reformed, and now 'lips that touch wine
shall never touch mine.' Joseph, I would reclaim you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
I would woo you tenderly from the jag path that
leadeth to destruction. It is broad and inviting at first,
but toward the finish it is rough, and hubbly, and painful
to travel. Pause while there is yet time. My
heart yearns to save you from destruction. Listen to
the pearly words of wisdom, that drop from my sweet
lips. Shun the jag juice and stick to the water-wagon.
Heed this advice and your days shall be long
ere you pass to the happy hunting-grounds."</p>

<p>"Heap talk a lot," said Joe; "no say anything.
Make Injun lot sicker!"</p>

<p>Gallup laughed heartily, slapping his knee.</p>

<p>"That's right, by gum!" he cried. "The wind blows
ev'ry time Jack opens his maouth."</p>

<p>"You are jealous," said Ready. "You are jealous
of my wisdom and eloquence. Get thee behind me,
Nose Talk! Your face is painful to look upon."</p>

<p>"Don't you go to makin' that kind of gab!" snapped
Gallup. "If yeou do, dinged if I don't jolt ye one in
the slats!"</p>

<p>"Such language! Slats! I'm shocked! Never have
you heard words of slang ripple from my tuneful vocal
chords. I disdain such frivolity! Slang gives me a
pain! Go lay down!"</p>

<p>"Lay!" snorted Ephraim. "I'm no hen!"</p>

<p>"Let's have breakfast," said Hodge. "We may as
well get on the move before it grows too hot."</p>

<p>It did not take long to prepare breakfast, but old
Joe seemed to grow ill at the sight of food. All he
wanted was water, and he threatened to drink the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
weak little spring dry. After a time, he seemed more
inclined to talk.</p>

<p>"No ketch Cim'r'n Bill?" he said.</p>

<p>"So you found out we were after him?" said Frank.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" nodded the Indian. "Joe no big fool only
when firewater is to get. He play poke', all time him
keep ear open. Mebbe him learn a whole lot."</p>

<p>"It's quite likely. If you had been with us yesterday,
we might have stuck to Bill's trail. Now it is
lost, and he may get away."</p>

<p>"Crowfoot he know how find Bill."</p>

<p>"What's that? You know how to find him?"</p>

<p>"Ugh!"</p>

<p>"Well, that is interesting, for I am bound to find
him. I gave Ben File my word to bring Bill back,
and I'm going to keep that promise. If you can
help&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You bet!" grunted Joe.</p>

<p>"How did you find out so much?"</p>

<p>"Joe him take drink in saloon. Keep much careful
not git full. Make um believe so. Go sleep. Hear
men talk in whisper. Waugh! Find out a heap."</p>

<p>"Well, you're a clever old rascal!" cried Merry;
"and I'm in love with you!"</p>

<p>"Joe him play game pritty slick," said the Indian.
"Same time him get one, two, three drink. That bad.
Make um want heap more. Make um take firewater
when um git out town."</p>

<p>"So you really got drunk because you were trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
to do me a good turn?" said Merry. "Joe, I appreciate
it! But what did you hear?"</p>

<p>"Bill him go to Sunk Hole."</p>

<p>"Sunk Hole?" cried Frank. "That place?"</p>

<p>"Where's that?" asked Hodge, who was deeply interested.</p>

<p>"Down in the White Mountain region, near the head
of Coyote Creek."</p>

<p>"Why did you exclaim, 'That place?'"</p>

<p>"Because it is a camp made up of the worst characters
to be found in the Southwest. It is a place
without law and order of any sort. Murderers, gamblers,
and knaves in general flee there when in danger.
They are banded together to defy the law. Travelers
who happen into that wretched place seldom come
forth. At times the ruffians quarrel among themselves
and shoot and kill with impunity. The people of the
Territory have more than once asked that the place
be invaded by troops and wiped off the map. It is a
standing disgrace."</p>

<p>"An' Cimarron Bill has gone there?" asked Ephraim
Gallup, his eyes bulging.</p>

<p>"So Joe says."</p>

<p>"Waal, I ruther guess yeou'll take a couple of
thinks afore ye foller him any furder."</p>

<p>"I shall follow him into Sunk Hole if I live!" declared
Merry grimly; "and I mean to bring him out
of the place, dead or alive. I do not ask the rest of
you to risk your lives with me. You are at liberty to
turn back. Joe&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Him stick by Strong Heart!" declared the old Indian
quickly. "You bet!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Joe!" said Frank. "I shall need you
to show me the road to the place, for I have heard
Sunk Hole is not easy to find."</p>

<p>"I hope," said Bart Hodge quietly, "that you do
not fancy for a moment that I'm not going with you?
I don't think you would insult me, Frank, by entertaining
such a thought. I shall be with you through
thick and thin."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Ready. "How brave you are!
Please stand in the glow of the limelight where we
can admire your heroic pose! La! la! You are a
sweet creature, and one to make the matinée girls rave
with adoration."</p>

<p>"Don't get so funny!" growled Hodge, who always
took Ready's chaffing with poor grace.</p>

<p>"Softly! softly!" smiled Jack, with a flirt of his
hand. "Let not your angry passions rise. You can't
play the bold and fearless hero any better than can
your humble servant. I'm in this, and you want to
watch me and note what a bold front I put on. I'll
wager a lead nickle you will begin to think me utterly
fearless, and all the while, beyond a doubt, I'll be
shaking in my boots. Oh, I can make an excellent
bluff when I have to."</p>

<p>"Bluff heap good sometime," said Crowfoot.
"Mebbe bluff take pot."</p>

<p>"But it's a mighty poor thing if the other fellow
suspects and calls," said Jack.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Waal," drawled Gallup, "darn my punkins! I
s'pose I'm in fer it, but I kinder wisht I was to hum
on the farm."</p>

<p>Frank knew the Vermonter well enough not to fancy
by those words that Ephraim was badly frightened.
It was Gallup's way of expressing himself, and, even
though he might be afraid in advance, the tall, lank
fellow always showed up well "in a pinch."</p>

<p>"Then it's settled," said Merry. "We all go."</p>

<p>"Joe him not talk all he find out," put in the Indian.</p>

<p>"Is there more? Well, give it to us quick. There
are many miles of alkali between here and Sunk Hole."</p>

<p>"Joe him hear men whisper 'bout gal."</p>

<p>"Eh? About a girl?"</p>

<p>"Ugh!"</p>

<p>"Then it must be about June Arlington? What
did they say?"</p>

<p>"Mebbe Bill him know where she is."</p>

<p>"What?" cried Merry, clutching the redskin by the
arm. "Is that possible?"</p>

<p>"Reckon um heap so."</p>

<p>"Then there is a double reason why I should get
my hands on Cimarron Bill!"</p>

<p>"Mebbe Joe he no hear right; no could ketch all
men whisper. He think gal she be took to Sunk
Hole."</p>

<p>Frank reeled, his face going white.</p>

<p>"Merciful Heaven!" he gasped. "June Arlington,
innocent little June! in that dreadful place? Come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
fellows, we must go! June Arlington there? The
thought is horrifying! If that is true, Cimarron Bill
may go free until I can do my best to get June out
of that sink of wickedness! Come, fellows&mdash;come!"</p>

<p>"We are ready!" they cried, in response.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>

<h3>FRANK IN SUNK HOLE.</h3>


<p>The Great Dipper indicated by its position that the
hour was not far from midnight. Crowfoot halted
and pointed downward, where, in the gloom of a
round valley, a few lights twinkled.</p>

<p>"Sunk Hole!" he said.</p>

<p>"At last!" breathed Frank.</p>

<p>The others stood in silence, looking down at those
lights. Suddenly they started, for to their ears came
the sound of music, dimly heard because of the distance.</p>

<p>"Perchance my ears deceive me," said Ready; "but
I fancy I hear the soothing strains of a fiddle."</p>

<p>"Sure as fate!" exclaimed Bart Hodge.</p>

<p>"Listen!" cautioned Merry.</p>

<p>There were other sounds, a sing-song cry at intervals,
and then hoarse laughter and several wild
whoops.</p>

<p>"By gum!" exclaimed Gallup. "Saounds jest like
one of them air country dances they uster hev over to
Billing's Corners, Varmount. The boys called them
'hog wrastles.'"</p>

<p>"See," said Merry, "there is one place that seems
more brightly lighted than the others. It's right in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
the center of the other lights. Fellows, I believe there
is a dance going on down there!"</p>

<p>"Just what I'm beginning to think," said Bart.</p>

<p>"My! my! How nice!" exclaimed Jack. "Let's go
right down and get into it! Balance your partners
all! All hands around! Let her sizzle!"</p>

<p>"That would be a splendid place for you to get into
a dance!" said Frank sarcastically.</p>

<p>"But a dance there!" exclaimed Hodge.</p>

<p>"It does seem mighty strange," agreed Frank. "Still
something of the kind is going on. Hear 'em yell!"</p>

<p>And now they could faintly hear the sound of feet
keeping time to the music.</p>

<p>"We've struck this place in a most excellent time to
get into it," said Merry. "I suppose one of us ought
to go back and watch the horses."</p>

<p>The horses had been left in a little pocket some distance
behind and they had climbed on foot to the
point where they could look down into the round valley.</p>

<p>"No need watch um now," said Joe. "Um hosses all
picket fast. We go down there, better go quick."</p>

<p>"Correct," agreed Frank. "Just show us how to
get down."</p>

<p>"Follow," said the redskin. "Take heap care."</p>

<p>The path over which he led them, if path it may be
called, was precarious enough. At times they felt that
they were on the edge of some precipice, with a great
fall lying beneath. But the aged redskin went forward
with surprising swiftness, causing them all to strain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
every nerve to keep up with him, and in time he
brought them down into the valley.</p>

<p>"Take lot care," cautioned Crowfoot. "Have guns
reddy. No can tell. May have to use um 'fore git
out."</p>

<p>"It's quite likely," said Merry grimly.</p>

<p>So they all made sure that their pistols could be
drawn quickly and readily, and then they crept toward
the dark huts, from the windows of which lights
gleamed.</p>

<p>The sounds of fiddling and dancing grew plainer and
plainer. Now and then a shout would awake the
echoes.</p>

<p>"Where do they find their 'ladies' for a dance?"
asked Hodge wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, there are a few women in this hole," answered
Merry. "Perhaps others have come in."</p>

<p>They reached the first hut and paused where they
could peer along the street, if such it could be called,
for the huts had been built here and there, so that the
road between them zig-zagged like a drunken man.</p>

<p>In the very center of the place was the building,
somewhat larger than its neighbors, from which came
the sounds of revelry. Doors and windows were wide
open. The music having stopped, there might be heard
a hum of voices, and then the wild, reckless laugh of a
woman floated out upon the night air.</p>

<p>Frank shuddered a little as he heard the sound,
which, to his ears, was more pitiful and appalling than
any cry of distress that could fall from female lips.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor creature!" he thought. "To what depths has
she fallen!"</p>

<p>They went forward again, slipping around a corner,
and Merry stumbled and fell over the body of a man
that was lying prone on the ground.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" he whispered. "Let's see what we have
here. It's a man, but I wonder if he is living or
dead."</p>

<p>He knelt and felt for the man's heart.</p>

<p>"Living all right," he declared; "but dead in one
sense&mdash;dead drunk! Whew! what a vile smell of
liquor!"</p>

<p>"Let him lie," said Hodge.</p>

<p>"I have a fancy to take a peep at him," said Frank.
"Hold still. I want a match. I have one."</p>

<p>Bringing out a match, he struck it and shaded it
with his hands, throwing the light on the prostrate
man.</p>

<p>The light of the match showed them that the fellow
was an unusually large Mexican, dressed after the
custom of his people in somewhat soiled finery.</p>

<p>"Dead to the world!" sighed Jack Ready softly.</p>

<p>The match died out in Frank's fingers, but Merry
did not rise.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked Jack. "Are you accumulating
his valuables?"</p>

<p>"Hardly," said Merry. "I'm thinking."</p>

<p>"Can such a thing make you think! What is passing
in your massive brain?"</p>

<p>"I have an idea."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's more than Ready ever hed," muttered Gallup.</p>

<p>"Fellows," said Frank, "this man's clothes ought to
be a fairly good fit for me."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to wear them. Get hold here, and we'll
carry him aside where there'll be little chance that any
one will stumble upon us. Let's move lively."</p>

<p>They did as directed, although wondering why
Frank should wish to exchange clothes with the
drunken Mexican.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE DANCE IN SUNK HOLE.</h3>


<p>A low-ceiled room with a bar at the end near the
door. The odor of smoke, liquor, and perspiration.
The place lighted with oil-lamps having dirty chimneys.
The lights of the lamps dancing and flaring to
the stamp of many heavy-shod feet. A maze of human
beings whirling, shifting, prancing, and cutting
figures on the floor. Rough-looking men, bearded and
armed; disheveled women, their faces glowing with
excitement and from the effects of drink. At the far
end of the room an old man, mounted on a square box
and seated on a chair, sawing away for dear life
at his fiddle, while he called the figures in a sing-song
tone.</p>

<p>And this was the way the fiddler called:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"First couple balance and swing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Promenade the inside ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Promenade the outside ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balance and swing and cast off six,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ladies to the right and gents to the left.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swing the one you swung before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the center and cast off four,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swing the one that comes to you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the center and cast off two."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The men were such as most women would avoid.
With few exceptions, they had wicked faces. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
had been drinking, and at intervals some elated and
enthusiastic fellow would utter a blood-curdling yell.</p>

<p>But the figures they cut were laughable at times.
They "spanked 'er down" furiously. They seized their
partners and swung them until often they were lifted
off their feet. But those were not the sort of women
to mind.</p>

<p>Three or four of the citizens of Sunk Hole were
married. Two had daughters old enough to be present
at the dance. Other "ladies" had come in from the
surrounding country, brought there by their partners.</p>

<p>There were a number of Mexicans in the crowd,
and three or four Mexican women.</p>

<p>Into this smoky room came yet another Mexican, a
young man, dressed in soiled finery, his wide-brimmed
high-peaked hat shading his face. He had a little
mustache that was pointed on the ends, and he walked
with a swagger. Immediately on entering he made
for the bar and called for a drink.</p>

<p>Had any one been watching him closely that person
must have noticed that he did not drink the stuff
put out to him, but slyly and deftly tossed the contents
of the glass into a corner under the bar.</p>

<p>This newcomer was Frank Merriwell, who had disguised
himself as well as possible and boldly walked
into this den of ruffians.</p>

<p>Having pretended to drink, Frank stood back in a
retired spot and looked the dancers over.</p>

<p>In a moment his eyes fell on Cimarron Bill, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
a Mexican girl for a partner and was enjoying himself
in his own peculiar way.</p>

<p>Frank knew it would not be safe to come face to
face with Bill, although he saw at once that the desperado
had been drinking heavily and could barely
"navigate" through the mazes of the dance.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gents chassé and put on style,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resash and a little more style&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little more style, gents, little more style,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>sang the fiddler; and the dancers strictly obeyed the
admonition by putting on all the style of which they
were capable.</p>

<p>Under different circumstances Merry would have
been amused by the spectacle; and even now, for all
of his peril, he was greatly interested.</p>

<p>Cimarron Bill was not habitually a hard drinker,
but on this occasion he had surprised everybody present
by the amount of whisky he had imbibed. He
seemed determined to get intoxicated, and it was plain
that he was making a success of it.</p>

<p>Frank did not wish to dance if he could avoid it,
knowing he might be brought face to face with Bill
in the course of some of the figures.</p>

<p>All around the sides of the room men were leaning
and looking on, some of them laughing and calling
to various dancers.</p>

<p>"Go it, Seven Spot!"</p>

<p>"Spank it down, Dandy!"</p>

<p>"Steady, Pie Face! Your left hoof belongs to the
church!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>"See Honeydew! He's a holy terror!"</p>

<p>"Watch Lanky Jim cut a pigeon wing!"</p>

<p>"Say, Big Kate can dance some! You bet your
boots!"</p>

<p>"Hi! hi! There goes Sweet William, plumb off his
pins!"</p>

<p>Now the fiddler was calling:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"First lady out to the right;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swing the man that stole the sheep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the one that packed it home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the one that eat the meat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the one that gnawed the bones."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Frank found an opportunity to slip along the wall
toward the back of the room. No one seemed to pay
any attention to him until he accidentally stepped on a
big fellow's foot. Instantly he was given a shove, and
the man growled:</p>

<p>"What in thunder ails ye, you yaller-skinned
greaser? Keep off my corns, ur I'll make hash o' you
with my toad-sticker!"</p>

<p>"Pardon, señor, pardon!" entreated Merry, in a soft
voice, with an accent that seemed perfectly natural.
"I deed not mean to do eet, señor."</p>

<p>"Ef I'd 'lowed ye did I'd sure slashed ye without
no talk whatever!" was the retort.</p>

<p>Having no desire to get into trouble, Merry took
great pains to avoid stepping on another foot, and he
finally reached the point he sought. In the corner at
the far end of the room there was not so much light.
A bench ran along there, and Frank found a seat on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
it, where he could lean against the thin board partition,
and he did not mind if some of the men stood
up before him so that he was partly screened.</p>

<p>Merry knew full well that he had done a most reckless
thing in entering that place, where all around him
were ruffians and murderers; but there was something
about the adventure that he relished, and the danger
gave it a spice that was far from disagreeable.</p>

<p>He thanked his lucky stars that this dance had given
him the opportunity to get in there without attracting
any more attention.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Meet your partner and all chaw hay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know where and I don't care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seat your partner in the old armchair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That particular dance ended with this call from the
fiddler; but there were no armchairs in which the
ladies could be seated, and Merry crowded up into the
corner in order to be as inconspicuous as possible and
to escape being disturbed.</p>

<p>There was a general rush for the bar, the fiddler
getting down from his box and hastening across the
floor, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
Some of the women accompanied their partners to the
bar and drank with them.</p>

<p>Such depravity was not pleasant to witness, and
Merry felt pity for the fallen creatures. Sentiment,
however, he sought to put aside, thinking only of the
dangerous mission that had brought him into that nest
of gambolling tigers.</p>

<p>Two men sat down near Merry. They had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
dancing, and observed, with some lurid embellishments,
that it was hot. Then one of them said something
that interested Frank.</p>

<p>"Bill's goin' it a whole lot stiff to-night."</p>

<p>"That's whatever. Never saw him punish the razzle
juice this way afore."</p>

<p>"You know why, mebbe."</p>

<p>"Waal, I opine he's some irked up over his mistake
in Holbrook. First time he ever shot the wrong
gent. He warn't gunnin' fer File. It was another
galoot he was after."</p>

<p>"I jedge that's the matter with him. Bandy tried to
joke him some about it, an' Bandy came mighty near
gettin' his."</p>

<p>"Bandy's a dern fool! He should 'a' knowed better
than to shoot off his mouth at Bill."</p>

<p>"I say so. But Bill he's a-playin' a right steep game
in that thar gal business."</p>

<p>"Bill kin play his keerds. You let him alone."</p>

<p>"No danger o' me chippin' in. They say the gal's
folks are a heap rich."</p>

<p>"I opine so, else Bill he'd never taken so much
trouble over her."</p>

<p>"Oh, I dunno; she's the purtiest leetle thing I ever
set my blinkers on. I 'lowed mebbe Bill was lookin'
some fer a wife."</p>

<p>"Wife&mdash;northin'! He's lookin' fer the dust. Why,
he sent word as how he'd skin the galoot what dared
hurt her or even say somethin' impolite afore her."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me tell you somethin'."</p>

<p>"Fire erway."</p>

<p>"Han'some Charley has seen that gal, an' I 'low he's
taken a likin' to her a whole lot. Bill better look sharp,
ur Charley will sure get away with her."</p>

<p>"I ain't the one to give Charley no advice, but if
I were, I'd whisper fer him to think twice afore tryin'
it."</p>

<p>"Charley's some clever. Look, thar he is a-drinkin'
with Bill now. Say, pard, I've got an idee that Charley's
doin' his best to load Bill to-night. If that's so,
he's got somethin' up his sleeve, an' we want to look
right sharp fer a breeze afore this dance is over. I'm
goin' to stand ready to duck instanter when the shootin'
begins."</p>

<p>Frank could peer past a man in front of him without
moving and see the person referred to as Handsome
Charley, who was drinking with Cimarron Bill
at the bar. This man was larger than Bill and heavier.
He had a flushed, reckless face that wore a smile nearly
all the time. He had a dark mustache and imperial,
and there was about him the atmosphere of a dashing
desperado.</p>

<p>Charley at this time seemed very friendly with
Cimarron Bill, and it was plain that he was urging
Bill to drink again.</p>

<p>"All right," thought Frank; "I'll watch you both."</p>

<p>At this moment a man appeared in the open door
and looked timidly into the room.</p>

<p>At sight of this man Frank gave a start in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
of his wonderful nerve, and it was only with the greatest
difficulty that he kept himself from crying forth
a name.</p>

<p>Eliot Dodge, the crafty lawyer with the blue nose,
stood there in the door. No wonder Merry was astounded
to see that man appear in such a place and
at such a time.</p>

<p>Dodge was rather pale, but an expression of relief
flashed over his face when his eyes fell on Cimarron
Bill. Then he stepped into the room.</p>

<p>Bill seemed no less astonished, but he advanced to
meet Dodge, holding out his hand, which the lawyer
accepted.</p>

<p>"However is this, Mr. Dodge?" inquired Bill. "I
sure am a whole lot surprised to meet up with you
here&mdash;that is, I'm surprised to have it occur so soon.
Will you wash the dust out of your throat?"</p>

<p>"Don't care if I do," said Dodge, and they crowded
nearer to the bar.</p>

<p>"Bill, I thinks mebbe you might present yer friend,"
chipped in Handsome Charley.</p>

<p>"Waal, Charley," said Bill, "this yere is Mr.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lewis," interposed Dodge quickly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lewis," said Bill queerly. "Mr. Lewis, permit
me to make you acquainted with Charley Sears,
generally called Handsome Charley. Will you take
a little pisen with us, Charley?"</p>

<p>Handsome Charley gave Dodge his hand, which the
lawyer shook gingerly, his coolness causing the fellow
to frown.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>They all drank, and Bill lurched, catching at the
edge of the bar.</p>

<p>"'Scuse me," he said, with unusual politeness. "Always
makes me dizzy to dance. There is a right good
lot of whirlin' around in it, you know."</p>

<p>Charley smiled.</p>

<p>"You had a fine partner that last dance, Bill; but
you ought to bring out that handsome gal an' take a
spin with her, man. I 'low it ain't right to keep her
under kiver when every gent yere is yearnin' to set
eyes on her."</p>

<p>"They'll have to keep right on yearnin'," averred
Bill, frowning.</p>

<p>"You're gettin' a whole lot selfish," declared Charley.
"Are you afeared some other gent will git her
away from ye if you brings her out?"</p>

<p>"None at all, Charley. But she ain't for this gang
to hustle around any, and that's level."</p>

<p>At this the other seemed to take offense.</p>

<p>"I opine, Bill," he said, "that you don't set yourself
up as a heap better than the rest of this gang?"</p>

<p>The cruel face of Cimarron Bill took on an expression
that was a warning.</p>

<p>"Charley," he said, in a low, smooth voice, with one
hand on the bar to steady himself, "I am willing to
confess that you disturbs me some. I has my reasons
for not bringin' the gal out, an' you'll sure excuse
me if I don't recite them none at present. Some other
time I may explain."</p>

<p>But Charley persisted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some other time it will be too late," he said. "I'm
certain looking to dance one set with the little beauty
myself, Bill."</p>

<p>"Sorry to disappoint you," returned Bill; "but the
young lady doesn't dance none, if you want to know
one good reason."</p>

<p>"Well, at least, you can bring her forth and permit
us to gaze upon her a while," suggested Charley.</p>

<p>"Not to-night," was the firm retort.</p>

<p>"Then it certain will seem a heap like you thought
her too good for us, and the boys won't like that a
great deal if I tell 'em so."</p>

<p>Bill leaned on the bar, his back against it and his
elbows resting so that his hands were close to his
hips. In that manner he stood perfectly steady, and
he was in a position to draw his pistols quickly.</p>

<p>"Charley," he said, his voice like the purring of a
cat, all the thickness seeming gone from his tongue,
while his wicked eyes narrowed to two thin slits, "I
don't think you'll go for to say anything whatever to
the boys on this point. You are my friend, I opine.
Am I sure right on that?"</p>

<p>At this juncture Handsome Charley realized all at
once that Bill was not yet drunk enough not to be
deadly. Charley's eyes noted in a flash how the man
had steadied himself and was ready for anything, and
Charley decided that the time was not yet ripe for
bringing on a quarrel.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm your friend, Bill!" he said, with
pretended heartiness, "and whatever you says goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
with me. I was just speakin' because I has heard some
of the boys growlin' over this business. That's all."</p>

<p>Bill smiled, but his smile was anything but pleasant.</p>

<p>"If any o' the boys growl around in your hearin'
some more," he said, "refer 'em to me, please. I reckons
I can certain stop their growlin' in a hurry."</p>

<p>"All right, all right!" nodded Charley.</p>

<p>"And you, pard," Bill went on&mdash;"you, I judge, will
say to them that I know my business a-plenty, and
that you backs me up. Eh?"</p>

<p>"Sure, sure, Bill."</p>

<p>"I thought you would," nodded the desperado with
the deadly eyes. "I opined I could depend on you."</p>

<p>"You bet! Have another drink, you and Mr.
Lewis?"</p>

<p>"Excuse us, please," urged Bill. "I hates most
mortally to decline; but I has some business to transact
with Mr. Lewis, an' I says business first an' pleasure
arterwards. Arter we has settled the business I'll
stand up here to this yere bar an' drink with you as
long as the pisen lasts. Is that all satisfactory like?"</p>

<p>This question was put in a manner that indicated
beyond question that it would be best for Charley to
acknowledge that it was satisfactory, and the acknowledgment
was made.</p>

<p>"Thanks," bowed Bill. "You're a sure enough gent,
Charley, an' I'll shoot the galoot what says to the
contrary! An' now I reckons you'll excuse us a while.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Come, Mr. Lewis, thar's a small back room, an' we'll
jest step in thar."</p>

<p>Through this Dodge had stood there pale to the lips,
with the exception of his blue nose, for he realized
that these men were on the verge of a disagreement,
and he understood that a disagreement between them
meant shooting in short order. Bill, however, had
won out by a display of calm assurance and nerve,
which was remarkable, considering his condition.</p>

<p>The ruffian slipped an arm through that of Dodge,
and they crossed the floor and passed through a narrow
door just as the fiddler resumed his seat and called
for the men to select partners and form for the next
dance.</p>

<p>Frank had watched every move, realizing full well
that there was a possibility of a "gun play" between
those two desperadoes. He was unable to hear what
passed between them, but still he fancied he knew the
bulk of it, and, in spite of himself, in spite of the
character of the man, he could not help admitting
Cimarron Bill's masterfulness. Frank comprehended
that Charley had thought at first of forcing a quarrel,
but had been cowed by Bill's manner.</p>

<p>The agitation of Eliot Dodge was also quite apparent.
Merry had already marked Dodge down as a
coward.</p>

<p>When the two men passed into the back room Frank
longed to follow them. He sat there, wondering what
course to pursue.</p>

<p>That June Arlington was somewhere in Sunk Hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
he now felt certain. The talk of the two men who had
been seated near him was assurance enough on that
point.</p>

<p>But where was she? How was he to find and rescue
her? This task he now understood as the most
important one before him and the one to which he was
to give his attention at once, regardless of the capture
of Bill, which could be accomplished later.</p>

<p>As he sat there, thinking the affair over and seeking
to decide on some course to pursue, he was surprised
and pleased to distinctly hear Bill speaking in the room
beyond the board partition. These boards were thin
and badly matched, so that there were large cracks at
intervals. One of these cracks happened to be just behind
Frank's head. By shifting his position slightly,
he brought his ear close to the crack.</p>

<p>The fiddler was tuning up, and the rough men and
women were laughing as they formed on the floor for
the next dance.</p>

<p>Frank was able to concentrate his mind on anything
he chose, at the same time becoming quite oblivious
to everything else; and now he shut out the sounds
of the room in which he sat and listened with all his
ability to hear what passed beyond the partition.</p>

<p>"Sure, partner," Bill's voice was saying, "it surprises
me a whole lot to see you come pokin' in here.
However did you git here?"</p>

<p>"Terry came with me all the way. You said he
would bring word to you from me, but I could not
wait. I wanted to have a talk with you face to face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
without trusting to any middle man. I felt that I
must do it, and that's what brought me here for one
thing."</p>

<p>"Waal, here you are, and now open up. I'm ready
to listen to anything whatever you has to say."</p>

<p>"In the first place," Frank distinctly heard Dodge
say, "Ben File is dead."</p>

<p>"Say you so?" exclaimed Bill, and his voice indicated
regret. "I allow I'm a-plenty sorry."</p>

<p>"It was bad work."</p>

<p>"That's right. Don't know how I happened to do
anything like that. Never did afore. I saw Merriwell
make a jump, and I thought from the way he done it
the bullet sure had gone clean through him."</p>

<p>"And you never touched him!"</p>

<p>"Don't rub it in harder than you kin help, Mr.
Dodge!"</p>

<p>"Hush! Don't speak that name here! It must not
get out that I'm in this game! It would ruin me!"</p>

<p>"That's all right, pard; no danger. Hear the racket
out yonder in that room. Nobody would ever think o'
tryin' to hear what we're sayin'."</p>

<p>"Still it will be better to keep on calling me Lewis.
It's a dangerous game we've tackled, and I want to
get it through in a hurry now. That's why I'm here."</p>

<p>"Waal, whatever do you say is the next move?"</p>

<p>"Merriwell got out of Holbrook right after you."</p>

<p>"I knows it. The gent sure chases me a distance,
but he gits lost, together with his pards, some time
afore night."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, now is the time to make the demand on Mrs.
Arlington for the ransom money. It must be rushed
along. She's in a state of mind so that she'll be sure
to give up easy now. I've waited for this, and I find
she will pay well to have June returned to her unharmed."</p>

<p>"That's a heap soothin' and agreeable news. I has
waited fer you to say when it was best to make the
demand on the old lady."</p>

<p>"And I've waited until I felt sure she was so distressed
and agitated that she would yield. She did
not wish her husband to know of her presence here,
and so she sent no word to him at first. Now she has
wired him the whole facts, and we can reckon that he'll
be coming this way as fast as steam can carry him.
It's best to get the whole deal through, if possible,
before he shows up."</p>

<p>"I'm for it."</p>

<p>"You must write a demand on the woman for the
boodle. She has diamonds and jewels with her on
which she can raise ten thousand dollars. Make her
raise it at once. Don't let her delay. Frighten her
into it."</p>

<p>"I opines I can do that. I'll give her a scorcher.
I'll tell her the gal is all safe an' onharmed, but she
has to plunk down instanter or I'll send her one o'
Miss June's fingers to hurry her up a leetle."</p>

<p>"That will go. I think that ought to start her."</p>

<p>"If you says so, I'll make it stiffer. What if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
adds that one o' the gal's prittey hands will foller?
or an ear&mdash;mebbe that's better?"</p>

<p>"As you choose. Say that the money is to be placed
in my hands to be delivered to your agent, who will
meet me on the open plain ten miles from Holbrook
in whatever direction you choose. Then I can ride
out with it and come back, and you can bring the girl
into town under cover of night."</p>

<p>"I reckon that ought to work, partner. This yere
game is your plannin', an' I falls inter it because I
reckons it was easier than gittin' ahead o' Merriwell
an' seizin' the mine. Had I shot up Merriwell, instead
o' File, I'd 'a' called on the lady hard fer the
price, which, together with the money I'll get out o'
this strike, would have made me easy for a right good
while."</p>

<p>"I'm against your idea of trying to saddle the kidnaping
onto Merriwell."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it will go. Merriwell might return to
Holbrook. If the demand for money had his name
attached, his arrest would seem to put him where it
would be necessary for him to produce the girl. Mrs.
Arlington was for forcing him to do so when File
took him. Anything like that would cause delay, and
delay is something we do not want."</p>

<p>"Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;Mr. Lewis, you sure reasons correct.
We'll jest hitch a made-up name to the demand for
money, which will be a whole lot better."</p>

<p>"I think so. And now let's write this demand, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
that I may turn about and get out of this hole immediately.
You must furnish me with a fresh horse. I'm
supposed now to be searching for Merriwell, several
men in town having set out upon the same task, for
Mrs. Arlington offered a reward for his recapture. I
will be able to make a very satisfactory explanation of
my absence from Holbrook."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<h3>DEAD OR LIVING.</h3>


<p>Frank's feelings on listening to this talk, the greater
part of which he was able to hear very well, may be
imagined far more easily than described. At last he
was in full possession of the facts relating to the abduction
of June Arlington, and a greater piece of villainy
had never come to his knowledge. From
the first he had regarded Eliot Dodge as a scoundrel
of the worst type; but he had not gaged the man as
one who would enter into such a desperate scheme as
this.</p>

<p>Merry had also learned that Ben File was dead, and,
therefore, he was released from his promise to bring
back Cimarron Bill.</p>

<p>Immediately his one thought turned to June and to
the devising of some method of discovering her whereabouts
and going to her rescue. Later he could think
of other things; but not until this great object had
been accomplished.</p>

<p>The voices of the men ran on in the little room,
though words grew fewer, and Merry knew the demand
for the ransom money was being written.</p>

<p>For a moment he thought of the satisfaction it would
give him to expose the rascally lawyer and bring him
to the end of his tether. Then he saw Handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Charley speaking quietly in the ear of a man, afterward
passing on to another and yet another. There
was something in Charley's manner that seemed very
significant.</p>

<p>"There's trouble brewing for Bill," Frank decided.
"It's coming as sure as fate."</p>

<p>He felt for his own weapons, making sure they were
where he could draw them and use them without delay;
but Frank did not propose to become involved in
the affair unless circumstances made it impossible to
keep out.</p>

<p>Again he listened at the crack in the partition, hoping
that some word passed between Dodge and Bill
would tell him where June was hidden. In this Merry
was disappointed. True, Dodge asked about the girl
and Bill assured him that she was perfectly safe and
unharmed, but that was all.</p>

<p>The dance was over and another was in progress
when Bill and Eliot Dodge came from that back room.
Handsome Charley and his satellites were watching
these two men. But they were permitted to pass to
the door, where Bill shook hands with Dodge, who
hurried forth into the night.</p>

<p>"How is that, Bill?" demanded Charley, hastily approaching.
"I opine you agreed that you an' your
friend would sure drink with me arter your business
was over. I notices that he has hiked."</p>

<p>Bill turned.</p>

<p>"Count me in, Charley," he said easily. "Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;Lewis,
he didn't hev time. My neck is again a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
whole lot dry, and I'll be pleased to irrigate with
you."</p>

<p>So they stood up to the bar, and Frank saw a number
of men drawing near from different directions,
all coming forward quietly.</p>

<p>Charley openly expressed his disapproval of the conduct
of Eliot Dodge.</p>

<p>"He certain was most onmannerly, Bill," he declared.</p>

<p>"Forget it," advised Bill curtly.</p>

<p>And this was not at all agreeable to the other.</p>

<p>"Mebbe I can't do that none," said Charley; "but
I'll tell ye, Bill, what will help a whole lot."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Bill.</p>

<p>"You has right up-stairs in this same ranch a
young lady what is handsome enough to make any
gent fergit a wrong, an' her I most mightily wants
to bring down yere."</p>

<p>Frank heard the words distinctly, and they gave
him a start. Handsome Charley was speaking of June
Arlington; there could be no doubt of that. He said
June was "up-stairs in that same ranch." At last
Frank had received the clue he was seeking.</p>

<p>More than Merry saw trouble was brewing between
Charley and Bill, and now the attention of almost
every person in the room was directed toward them.</p>

<p>Bill's face grew grim, and again his eyes narrowed
and glittered.</p>

<p>"See yere," he said harshly, "I allows we has settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
the p'int in regard to her, an' so you lets it drop,
Charley."</p>

<p>Frank knew that pistols would be out in a few seconds
more. He did not wait for the men to draw and
begin to shoot.</p>

<p>There was no flight of stairs in the room where the
dance was taking place, and, therefore, he immediately
decided that the stairs might be found in the
back room, where the interview between Bill and Eliot
Dodge had taken place. The door leading into that
room was closed, but Frank slipped quickly to it, and it
readily opened before his hand.</p>

<p>He found himself in a bare room, having but little
furniture, a table, a bed, some chairs, and, as Frank
had believed likely, a steep flight of stairs ran railless
up one side of the room, disappearing at a dark landing
above.</p>

<p>In a twinkling Merry was bounding lightly up those
stairs, the sounds of loud and angry voices coming
from the dance-room, where the music and dancing
had now stopped.</p>

<p>Frank knew that whatever he did must be done in
a hurry, for, allowing that in the trouble in the dance-room,
Handsome Charley should come forth triumphant
it was likely that June would be sought by
some of those ruffians.</p>

<p>The thought of this spurred Merry on. He pictured
to himself the terror of the poor girl seized by those
men and dragged into the presence of the mob below.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>"They shall not touch her!" he muttered. "If I can
reach her, they shall not touch her!"</p>

<p>Then he found himself, in the gloom of the landing,
against a heavy door. He sought to open it, but
it was locked.</p>

<p>From below came the sound of a shot. Then there
were shouts and other shots.</p>

<p>"The devils have broken loose!" exclaimed Merry,
and he wondered how it fared with Bill.</p>

<p>In vain he felt for the fastenings of the door. His
heart smote him with the fear that it would withstand
any attack he might direct upon it.</p>

<p>Then he found a match and struck it. The light
showed him something that made his heart leap with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Across the face of the door, lying in iron slots, was
an iron bar that held it fast.</p>

<p>The match was dropped in a twinkling, and Frank's
fingers lifted the bar from the slots and its socket.
Then he easily opened the door.</p>

<p>At that instant it seemed as if pandemonium broke
loose below. There was a perfect fusillade of shots,
hoarse shouts from men and wild shrieks from women.
There was likewise a terrible crash, as if some part of
the building had been ripped down.</p>

<p>"June!" called Frank. "June! June!"</p>

<p>The room in which he found himself was dark and
silent.</p>

<p>"June! June! I am a friend! Answer me!"</p>

<p>Still silence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>Again he brought forth and struck a match. It
flared up in his fingers, and he lifted it above his
head, looking all around.</p>

<p>Stretched on the floor in a huddled heap in one corner
was the body of a girl. The glance he had obtained
convinced him that it was June beyond question.</p>

<p>Frank sprang forward, again speaking her name
and assuring her that he was a friend.</p>

<p>In the darkness he found her with his hands. She
did not move when he touched her, and his fingers ran
to her face. It was cold as marble to the touch, and a
great horror filled his soul.</p>

<p>"Merciful God!" he groaned, starting back a little.
"They have killed her. The devils!"</p>

<p>The shock was so great that he remained quite still
on his knees for a few moments.</p>

<p>He was aroused by the sound of heavy feet upon the
stairs.</p>

<p>Frank sprang up and dashed across the room to the
door.</p>

<p>The door leading into the dance-room had been left
wide open below. He saw that a number of men
had entered the back room, and already two or three
were on the stairs. Handsome Charley was at their
head.</p>

<p>Frank was trapped!</p>

<p>At once he realized that Cimarron Bill was, beyond
a doubt, lying in a pool of his own blood in the dance-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
At last the most desperate and dangerous man-killer
of the Southwest had met his master.</p>

<p>Merry had little time, however, to think of anything
like this. His own life was in the utmost peril. He
drew his revolver, and, with the utmost coolness, put
a bullet through Handsome Charley's right shoulder.</p>

<p>With a cry, the man fell back into the arms of the
one directly behind him, and that fellow was upset,
so that all were swept in a great crash to the foot of
the stairs.</p>

<p>"Perhaps that will hold you for a while!" muttered
Frank, as he picked up the iron bar and promptly closed
the door at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>He had seized the bar because he thought it might
be a good weapon of defense in case his revolvers
should be emptied and he remained in condition to
fight. Now he thought of something else, and decided
that the bar might do for a prop at the door.</p>

<p>"There ought to be some other way out of this
room," he muttered. "Isn't there even a window?"</p>

<p>Again he struck a match, looking around with the
aid of its light.</p>

<p>At the end of the long room in which he found himself
he fancied he must find a window. Toward this
end of the room he hurried, and another match disclosed
to him a window that was hidden by heavy
planking. Plainly the planks had been spiked over
the window after it was decided to hold June a prisoner
in that room.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>Down dropped the match, and instantly Frank attacked
the planks with the iron bar.</p>

<p>Fortune must have favored him, for had it been
light he could not have been more successful. Every
stroke was effective, and he began ripping off the
planks.</p>

<p>There was wild excitement below, and Merry prayed
for a little time. His heart was filled with a hope
that Handsome Charley's fate would be a warning
to others, so they would not be eager to rush up the
stairs to the door.</p>

<p>In just about one minute he had torn the planks
from the window.</p>

<p>Once more he heard men ascending the stairs. Instantly
he dashed across the floor, finding the door
in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Halt!" he cried savagely, from behind the closed
door. "Halt, or I fire!"</p>

<p>Then he sought to prop the door with the iron bar,
pressing it down in such a position that it might hold
for some moments against an ordinary attack upon it.</p>

<p>"I'll shoot the first man who tries to open this door!"
he shouted.</p>

<p>But he did not remain there to await an effort to
open the door. Instead he quickly found the girl in
the corner, lifted her limp body, and sought the window
once more.</p>

<p>Reaching the window, Frank promptly kicked out
sash and glass with two movements of his foot.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>Bang! bang! bang!&mdash;sounded heavy blows on the
door behind him, but the iron bar was holding well.</p>

<p>Merry swung his leg over the window-ledge. Desperate
as he was, he meant to venture a leap from the
window to the ground with the girl in his arms.</p>

<p>But just then, pausing to look down, he was amazed
and delighted to see below him his four friends, who
were on the point of entering the building, led by Bart
Hodge. Instantly Frank hailed them.</p>

<p>"Catch her!" he cried, swinging the girl out over
the window-ledge, so that they could see her below.</p>

<p>Immediately Bart and Ephraim extended their arms
and stood ready.</p>

<p>"Let her come!" shouted Hodge.</p>

<p>Frank dropped the girl, and the two young men
clutched at her as she fell directly into their arms.</p>

<p>At that moment the door behind Merry flew open
with a slam and the ruffians came bursting into the
room.</p>

<p>One of them held a lighted lamp.</p>

<p>The fellow in advance saw Frank in the window and
flung up his hand. There was a loud report and a
burst of smoke. When the smoke cleared the window
was empty, Frank having disappeared.</p>

<p>"Nailed him!" shouted the ruffian who had fired.
"Nailed him for sure!"</p>

<p>He rushed forward to the window and looked down,
expecting to discover the body of his victim stretched
on the ground. But in this he was disappointed, for
neither Frank nor his friends were beneath the window.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
Into the darkness of the crooked street some
dusky figures were vanishing.</p>

<p>Frank had leaped from the window, being untouched
by the bullet that fanned his cheek in passing. He
struck on his feet, but plunged forward on his hands
and knees. In a moment he was jerked erect by some
one who observed:</p>

<p>"Methinks your parachute must be out of order.
You descended with exceeding great violence. What
think you if we make haste to depart?"</p>

<p>"Jack!" exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p>"The same," was the assurance, as Ready clutched
his arm and started him on the run. "Dear me! I
know this strenuous life will yet bring me to my
death!"</p>

<p>Ahead of them Frank saw some figures moving hastily
away.</p>

<p>"The girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They've got her," assured Jack. "Old Joe is with
them. We'll talk it over later."</p>

<p>So they ran, well knowing the whole of Sunk Hole
would be looking for them within thirty minutes. It
did not take them long to come up with Bart, Ephraim,
and old Joe.</p>

<p>Behind them there sounded shouts and commands,
and it was well the whole of Sunk Hole had been at
the dance, else the place must have been aroused so
that they would have run into some of its inhabitants.
Here and there amid the buildings they dodged until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
they arrived at the edge of the collection and struck
out for the side of the valley, Crowfoot leading.</p>

<p>It was necessary to trust everything to the old Indian.
Without him they could not have known with
any certainty that they were taking the proper course to
enable them to get out of the valley.</p>

<p>The girl was passed from one to another as they ran.
They did not waste their breath in words.</p>

<p>The old Indian ran with an ease that was astonishing,
considering his years.</p>

<p>Looking back, they could see torches moving swiftly
here and there through the town, telling that the
search for them was being carried on.</p>

<p>Soon they came to a steep gully that led upward,
and the ascent was very difficult, even at first. It
grew more and more difficult as they ascended, and it
became necessary for them to work slowly in the darkness,
the girl being passed upward from time to time,
as one after another took turns at creeping ahead.</p>

<p>Joe did not seem to have much trouble, but he did
not bother with the girl. Finally he said:</p>

<p>"Here come bad palefaces! Make some big hurry!"</p>

<p>It was true that a party of men were running toward
the gully. Their torches danced and flared, showing
them with some distinctness.</p>

<p>To the right and left in other parts of the valley
were clusters of torches.</p>

<p>"Heap try to stop us," exclaimed Crowfoot. "One
way to go up there, 'nother way down there, this be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
'nother way. They know all. That how um come
here so fast."</p>

<p>By the time the men with the torches reached the
foot of the gully Frank and his comrades were so far
above that they were not betrayed by the torchlight.
But one of the ruffians bade the others listen, and at
that very moment Ephraim Gallup dislodged a stone
that went clattering and rattling downward with a
great racket.</p>

<p>Instantly a wild yell broke from the lips of the
ruffians below.</p>

<p>"Here they are!" they shouted. "They're up here!"</p>

<p>Then one of them began to blaze away with his pistols,
and the bullets whistled and zipped unpleasantly
close to the party above.</p>

<p>Bart Hodge stooped and found some rocks as large
as ducks' eggs in the hollow of the gully. He knew it
would expose their position if he should answer the
fire with his revolvers, and so he simply hurled those
rocks with all the accuracy and skill that had made him
noted on the baseball diamond as a wonderful thrower
to second base.</p>

<p>The first rock struck a fellow on the wrist and broke
it. The third hit another man on the shoulder, and
not many of the six Bart threw failed to take effect.</p>

<p>Astonishing though it seemed, this method of retorting
to the shooting proved most effective, and the
ruffians scattered to get out of the way, swearing horribly.</p>

<p>The fugitives continued till the top of the gully was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
reached and they struck something like a natural path
that soon took them where they could no longer see
the valley nor hear their enemies.</p>

<p>Knowing they would be followed still farther, they
halted not for a moment until their horses were
reached. Then they paused only to make ready and
swing into the saddle.</p>

<p>Even as June was passed up to Frank she sighed and
seemed to come a little to herself. And as they rode
into the dusk of the night she recovered consciousness,
the cool breeze fanning her face. She wondered and
shuddered until she heard the voice of Frank Merriwell
reassuring her, and then she was certain that it
was all a dream. In her prison room she had listened
with shaking soul to the sounds from below, she had
crept to the barred door and heard Cimarron Bill and
Eliot Dodge talking below, and the horror of knowing
the rascally lawyer was in the plot that had brought
about her abduction and detention in that den had been
a fearful shock to her. When the quarreling and the
shooting began, she was filled with mortal dread. She
heard some one on the stairs and fumbling at her door,
and then, kneeling in a corner of the room, all the
world slipped away from her, and she remembered
nothing more until she awoke in the arms of her
brave rescuer, Frank Merriwell.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>




<h2><a href="#CONTENTS" name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>

<h3>THE RETURN TO HOLBROOK.</h3>


<p>Haggard from worriment and need of sleep, her face
seeming drawn and old, her eyes feeling like coals in
her throbbing head, Mrs. Arlington welcomed Eliot
Dodge, who came into the room, looking dejected yet
seeming to appear hopeful.</p>

<p>"June! June, my child?" cried the tortured mother.
"Have you no news of her?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but&mdash;this," said Dodge, pulling out an unsealed
letter.</p>

<p>Then he briefly told of being held up by three ruffians,
who had given him the letter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arlington read it, and fell half-fainting on the
couch, while Dodge bent over her with protestations
of sympathy.</p>

<p>"My poor girl!" gasped the miserable woman. "And
she is in the power of such monsters! The ransom
money must be paid! She must be saved at once!"</p>

<p>"Is there no way to avoid paying the money?" said
Dodge. "Is it not possible she may be saved in some
other manner?"</p>

<p>"I think it is," said a clear voice, as the door was
thrust open and Frank Merriwell, covered from head
to heel with the dust of the desert, escorted the rescued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
girl into the room. "Mrs. Arlington, I have
brought you your daughter."</p>

<p>With a scream of joy, Mrs. Arlington leaped up and
June ran into her arms.</p>

<p>Eliot Dodge seemed to turn green. He stood and
stared at the girl in a sort of blank stupor, failing to
observe that just behind Frank Merriwell, who still
wore the clothes taken from the intoxicated Mexican,
there was the officer newly appointed to fill the place
left vacant by the death of Ben File.</p>

<p>"June! June! June!" cried Mrs. Arlington, her face
flushed with gladness. "Is it you, my poor girl! I
can scarcely believe it! How does it happen? Tell me
how you come to be here!"</p>

<p>"I am here, mother, because I was rescued from
those horrible ruffians by that brave gentleman whom
you have so greatly wronged, Frank Merriwell. He
risked his life for me. I will tell you all, but first&mdash;first
I must tell you that you have trusted a snake. I
mean that monster there!"</p>

<p>She pointed her finger at Dodge, who started and
looked startled, but pretended the utmost amazement.</p>

<p>"He is the villain who planned it all!" declared June.
"I know, for I heard them talk it over. But he shall
not escape!"</p>

<p>"I hardly think so," said Frank. "Officer, he is a
desperate man. Be careful of him."</p>

<p>"This is an outrage!" declared Dodge, as the new
city marshal grasped him. "I'll not permit it!
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank clutched him on the other side, and, a moment
later, the officer had ironed his prisoner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arlington would have interfered, but Merry
declared he had sworn out the warrant for Dodge's
arrest, and she saw it was useless.</p>

<p>"Madam," said Frank, "I will leave you alone with
your daughter. When she has told you all, you will
be ready, I am confident, to prosecute Eliot Dodge. I
shall then withdraw my charge and permit you to have
him arrested. In the meantime I bid you good day.
I shall be in this hotel for the next day or so."</p>

<p>He bowed gracefully to both Mrs. Arlington and
June and left the room.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When there was plenty of time, Frank and his
friends talked it over. He told them of his experience
in the dance-room, and they told him how they
had lingered near, ready to rush to his rescue. When
they heard the sounds of the quarrel between Cimarron
Bill and Handsome Charley they hurried to the door,
but there they halted, for they looked in and saw
nothing of Frank. Thus it was that they beheld the
shooting of Bill as he tried to draw on Charley. He
was shot down from behind by Charley's tools, and
they fired several bullets into his body as he lay weltering
on the floor.</p>

<p>Frank shook his head as he heard this account of
Bill's end.</p>

<p>"He was a bad man, a very bad man," he said; "but
somehow I'm sorry that he met his end that way.
They had to shoot him from the rear. Not one of them
dared pull on him face to face."</p>

<p>Frank received a brief letter from Mrs. Arlington,
thanking him for what he had done for her daughter.
Not one word did she say of her own malevolence
toward him, not one word of the manner in which
she had wronged him. And the doctor, who brought
the letter, told Merry that she was in such a precarious

she be seen by any one but June.</p>

<p>Frank smiled grimly, disdainfully, over the letter,
then deliberately tore it into shreds.</p>

<p>But he had proved his manhood, and June Arlington,
for all of her mother, found time to see him a few
moments before he left town. After that brief time
with June he rode light-heartedly away, his friends
galloping at his side and listening to the cowboy song
that came from his lips.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
